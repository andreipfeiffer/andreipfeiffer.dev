          There are more than 50 different CSS-in-JS libraries out there and
          each of them provides a unique combination of features.

          Instead of reviewing each individual library, weâ€™ll analyse the

          understand what solution might work best for specific use-cases.

        In this talk, I touch upon a correlation between <em>simplicity</em> and{" "}

        with on a daily basis.
