          Simple solutions usually require a lot of effort during their usage,
          but they also provide a high level of control. Complex solutions are
          usually easy to use, but retain the control for themselves. This
          theory applies both at high-level architecture and also at low-level,
          day-to-day code design.

          We usually talk about 2 different types of Front-End/UI developers:

          <strong>engineer</strong> type focused on JS and frameworks. This

          websites and back office applications.

          But, when dealing with wep apps that are also client facing, we

          build such UIs.
