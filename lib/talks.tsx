          There are more than 50 different CSS-in-JS libraries out there and
          each of them provides a unique combination of features.

          Instead of reviewing each individual library, weâ€™ll analyse the
          various features that these libraries have to offer, to better
          understand what solution might work best for specific use-cases.

        <p>
          Simple solutions usually require a lot of effort during their usage,
          but they also provide a high level of control. Complex solutions are
          usually easy to use, but retain the control for themselves. This
          theory applies both at high-level architecture and also at low-level,
          day-to-day code design.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We'll explore different methods for tackling software complexity, by
          deeply understanding our users and deciding where to place the
          control: in the implementation, or in the consumer.

          This is a 2-part talk. The first part is an introduction to John
          Conway's Game of Life and some of it's practical applications today.

          React is fast enough, until it becomes slow. In this talk we'll

          We'll take a look at different situations when rendering bottlenecks
          can occur, measure rendering performance using{" "}

        <p>
          We usually talk about 2 different types of Front-End/UI developers:
          the <strong>designer</strong> type focused on HTML &amp; CSS, and the{" "}
          <strong>engineer</strong> type focused on JS and frameworks. This
          dychotomy matches perfectly the difference between client facing
          websites and back office web applications.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But, when dealing with wep apps that are also client facing, we
          witness a blend of design and engineering skills that are required to
          build such UIs.

          This talks describes the challenges of developing UIs that are need to
          communicate with external APIs. Using tools such as{" "}
          <strong>React Styleguidist</strong> or <strong>Storybook</strong> can
          help us to eliminate the need for an integration, enabling us to
          develop components in isolation, outside the application.

          Code breakpoints is something we're all used to. But Chrome Devtools

          Developers want to become "full stack". Companies hire full stack
          developers. Some say they are{" "}
          <em>"jack of all trades, master of none"</em>. The answer must be
          somewhere in the middle. We'll analyze the history of the term and

        <p>
          Breaking changes are a great way to improve software, by changing poor
          design and removing the bad parts. It's what all languages do at some
