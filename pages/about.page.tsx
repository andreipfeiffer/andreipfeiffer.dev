              <strong>Eclectic</strong> because I {"don't"} follow a specific

              apply various principles, practices, and technologies that
              actually suit the problem {"I'm "}
              facing, in a pragmatic fashion.

            <p>
              <strong>Code designer</strong> has a double meaning. First of all,{" "}
              {"I'm"} very keen about <strong>code design</strong> and
              maintaining a clean code base. Additionally, {"I'm"} also a hybrid
              between a <em>designer</em> and a <em>developer</em>. Besides
              being a software engineer working with <strong>code</strong>, I
              also have a strong passion for aesthetics, animations, structure,
              interaction, and everything related to <strong>design</strong> in
              a broad sense.
