      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I'm {getAge()} years old, living in Timi≈üoara, Romania.</p>

      <p>
        I've been designing &amp; developing websites and web apps since 2000
        and went through all the stages: from HTML3/jQuery to HTML5/ES6 and
        beyond. I like to think of myself as an{" "}
        <strong>eclectic code designer</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Eclectic</strong> because I don't follow a specific technology
        or a school of thought in a dogmatic way. Instead, I apply various
        practices and technologies that suit the problem I'm facing, in a
        pragmatic fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Code designer</strong> has a double meaning. First of all, I'm
        very keen about code design and maintaining a clean code base. But I'm
        also a hybrid between designer and developer, because I enjoy
        aesthetics, animations, interactions and everything related to{" "}
        <strong>design</strong>.

          My everyday battles revolve around Clean Code Design, User &amp;
          Developer Experience, UI Interaction &amp; Design, and fighting
          software entropy through constant Refactoring, Code Reviews, Unit
          Tests and Team Collaboration.

        <p>
          My current preferred tech stack include React/React Native,
          TypeScript, MobX, Jest, React Styleguidist and Next.js.
