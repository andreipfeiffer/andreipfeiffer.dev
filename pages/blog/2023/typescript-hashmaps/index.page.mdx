If you're not familiar with the term [Hash Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table), it refers to a simple **key-value pair** data structure, also known as **Hash Table**, **Record**, **Dictionary**, **Associative Array**, etc.

In this post, we'll explore different methods to implement Hash Maps with optional items in TypeScript and analyze the type safety when accessing the items.

- [Using a Plain JavaScript `Object`](#plain-javascript-objects)
- [Using a JavaScript `Map`](#javascript-maps)

<Note>The content of this post uses <b>TypeScript 5.3</b>, which is the latest version at the moment. If the behavior changes in future versions, I will update the content..</Note>

---

The use case we'll be exploring next is a data structure where the **keys are strings**, and the **values are booleans**.

We'll be using [strict type checking](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict), therefore we need to 1) define a type for the Hash Map, then 2) we'll initialize the data structure and 3) dynamically access its members.

```ts
// 1Ô∏è‚É£ define the type
type HashMap = /* TBD */;
// 2Ô∏è‚É£ initialize with data
const letters: HashMap = /* TDB */
// 3Ô∏è‚É£ dynamic member access
const A = hashMap["A"];
```

The goal is to **analyze the type-safety of the dynamic member access** using various methods.

<Note>For the sake of this example, I'm using <code>string/boolean</code> pairs, but the same behavior applies for any other types we might use.</Note>

## Plain JavaScript Objects

Let's start with the simplest way to define Hash Maps in JavaScript, using Plain Old JavaScript Objects, aka POJOs. The most straightforward way to define the type is to use [Index Signatures](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#index-signatures), by telling the compiler we'll deal with _objects having `strings` as keys and `booleans` as values_.

```ts
// 1Ô∏è‚É£ define the type
type HashMap = {
  [key in string]: boolean;
};
```

So, let's use the above type to initialize with some values and access a non-existent member.

```ts
// 2Ô∏è‚É£ initialize with data
const letters: HashMap = {
  "A": true,
}

// 3Ô∏è‚É£ dynamic member access
const A = hashMap["A"]; // ‚úÖ boolean
const X = hashMap["X"]; // ‚ùå boolean
```

For some reason, the type system sees an inexistent member as being a `boolean`, even with the `strict` compiler option enabled.

I was expecting to infer the type as `boolean | undefined`, because there is no guarantee that the Hash Map will contain a particular member. This behavior imprints a **false sense of safety**.

<Subheading>Explicit optional members</Subheading>

To fix this behavior and to enforce strict null checks in this case, we'll have to **explicitly define the properties as optional**:

```ts{2}
type HashMap = {
  [key in string]?: boolean; // notice the "?"
};

const letters: HashMap = {
  "A": true,
}

const A = letters["A"]; // üü° boolean | undefined
const X = letters["X"]; // ‚úÖ boolean | undefined
```

Now the compiler correctly infers the members as being potentially `undefined`, thus enforcing strict null checks wherever we use the result. But now, even the members that are explicitly defined at initialization are seen as optional.

<Subheading>Using <code>Record</code> utility type</Subheading>

TypeScript also provides a [Record](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type) utility type for more succinct type definitions.

```ts
type HashMap = Record<string, boolean>;
```

However, if we look at the implementation, it uses the same Index Signature as we used above. Therefore, the behavior is precisely the same.

<br />

To make the properties optional, we'll have to wrap it in a [`Partial`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype) utility type:

```ts
type HashMap = Partial<Record<string, boolean>>;
```

<Subheading>Using <code>noUncheckedIndexedAccess</code> compiler option</Subheading>

My body [Titian](https://twitter.com/TitianCernicova) highlighted that in version 4.1, released exactly 3 years ago in November 2020, TypeScript introduced a new compiler option called [`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noUncheckedIndexedAccess) to address exactly this sort of problems.

<Side header={{ file: "tsconfig.json", lang: "JSON" }}>

```json{3}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true
  }
}
```

</Side>

As mentioned in the docs, setting it to `true` in `tsconfig.json` will _add `undefined` to any un-declared field in the type_.

```ts{2}
type HashMap = {
  // notice the lack of optional specifier
  [key in string]: boolean;
};

const letters: HashMap = {
  "A": true,
}

const A = letters["A"]; // üü° boolean | undefined
const X = letters["X"]; // ‚úÖ boolean | undefined
```

The behavior is similar to the one with Explicit optional members.

However, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` also affects Arrays member access, which is a bit too aggressive according to the community, adding extra `undefined` inference, even when it's not necessary.

<Note title="NOT RECOMMENDED">
  You might wonder <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49169">Why isn't this enabled by default with <code>strict</code> mode</a>? The reason is that, as <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49169#issuecomment-1677712312">Ryan Cavanaugh</a> mentioned in his comment, the TypeScript team gets too many reports from the community that <em>"<code>noUncheckedIndexedAccess</code> is not smart enough"</em>, probably causing too much frustration.
  <br />
  <br />
  As a consequence, even the <strong>official TypeScript documentation doesn't label this option as recommended</strong>.
</Note>

## JavaScript Maps

A second approach to define Hash Maps is to use a [JavaScript Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), a dedicated construct for defining key-value pairs. TypeScript supports Maps out of the box.

```ts
// 1Ô∏è‚É£ define the type
type HashMap = Map<string, boolean>;
```

In contrast with POJOs, Maps are more complex data structures, providing their own API to insert, retrieve, and delete items.
```ts
// 2Ô∏è‚É£ initialize with data
const hashMap: HashMap = new Map();
hashMap.set("first", true);
hashMap.set("second", false);

// 3Ô∏è‚É£ dynamic member access
const item = hashMap.get("third");
// ‚úÖ item: boolean | undefined
```

However, when we access an item from the Map, TypeScript correctly infers its type as potentially `undefined` even without the `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` option. TypeScript performs only static analysis. Thus, it cannot guarantee that the item will actually be in the Map when the code will be executed at runtime.

## To conclude

As a non-expert in type systems, a **JavaScript `Map`** provides better type safety than POJOs, especially with data structures requiring dynamic access.

To get the same type-safe behavior with POJOs, we must remember to **explicitly define the items as optional**. Enforcing strict checks at the compiler level with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is probably a bit too aggressive.
