<Subheading>Example 2</Subheading>

Another example is a function that's fairly easy to figure out what it does. However, it includes a somewhat weird `if` statement:

```ts
function getEUVatCountryCode(countryCode: string, administrativeArea: string) {
  /**
   * NOTES:
   * 1. Northern Ireland changed VAT number after Brexit
   *    https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/?locale=en
   * 2. Google API returns Northern Ireland as an administrative area of GB
   */
  if (administrativeArea.toLowerCase() === "northern ireland") {
    return "XI";
  }

  if (isEuCountry(countryCode)) {
    return countryCode;
  }

  return "";
}
```

Since the code itself is not entirely self-explanatory, we could add additional comments to explain:

- What is the magic string `"XI"`?
- Why do we check the `administrativeArea` when dealing with countries?

<br />

Even if we refactor our code and extract it as explanatory identifiers, they still don't fully convey the "why". Therefore, **code comments are valuable to document the "why"**.

```ts
it("return empty string for non-EU location", () => {});
it("return 'XI' for Northern Ireland", () => {});
it.each(EU_COUNTRIES)("return CountryCode for EU (%s)", (code) => {});
```

```ts
function getEUVatCountryCode(countryCode: string, administrativeArea: string) {
  // https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/?locale=en
  const NORTHERN_IRELAND_VAT_CODE_AFTER_BREXIT = "XI";

  if (isNorthernIreland(administrativeArea)) {
    return NORTHERN_IRELAND_VAT_CODE_AFTER_BREXIT;
  }

  // ...
}

function isNorthernIreland(administrativeArea: string) {
  // Google API returns Northern Ireland as an administrative area of GB
  return administrativeArea.toLowerCase() === "northern ireland";
}
```

## Costs

Even though we cannot measure the cost of missing documentation, we can do some rough aproximations.

An Attlasian survey from 2024, filled by more than 2100 developers and managers, concludes that **insufficient documentation** is the second reason for waisted time during development.

The same survey concluded that developers lose about 8 working hours per week due to inefficiencies.
