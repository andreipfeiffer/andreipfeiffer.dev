There's an neverending debate between compile time and runtime. Between types and values. Between static analisys and dynamic analisys. Between type checkers and unit tests. Which side is more valuable? Personally, I've been pivoting a lot between the two sides quite a lot. They are both valuable, but in different ways.

<br />

**Runtime values and unit tests** provide information about what things _actually are_. They don't tell _how things should or could be_. Therefore, when we encounter some untyped code, we might have some questions about specific runtime values.

Let's consider an example of an Rest API call to fetch a list of messages for a chat component. The response contains an array of objects with various fields, but some of them in particular might raise some questions:

```json
// GET: /messages
[
  {
    "id": 8356,
    "content": "good morning, everyone!",
    // ... other fields
    "status": 2, // 1️⃣
    "messageType": "text", // 2️⃣
    "annotation": null // 3️⃣
  }
]
```

For instance, you might ask yourself:

1. what does `2` represent and what other values could the `status` field have?
2. are there any other types of messages besides `"text"`?
3. when could `annotation` be different than `null` and what data type is it?

<br />

**Types and static analisys** on the other hand describe the _theory_, what things _should or could be_. They describe _the contract and rules_ instead of the execution.

But in JS/TS land, types are completely stripped away at runtime, providing no actual guarantees. To add salt to injury, there are various levels of type-safety in TS, depending on the [strictness settings](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strict) in `tsconfig.json`. So, any contract we might have at compile time can be completely broken during execution.

<!--
Therefore, if we think about it in black and white, why use types at all if we don't get type safety guarantees?

However, as one business man once said:

> Contracts are valuable as long as both parties act in **good faith**.
-->

Also, TypeScript per-se doesn't implicitly help us. Even if _we use types_, the response might be typed as:

```ts
type MessageListResponse = Array<Message>;

type Message = {
  id: number;
  content: string;
  // ... other fields
  status: number; // 1️⃣
  messageType: string; // 2️⃣
  annotation: Annotation | null; // 3️⃣
};
```

The above type definition adds some additional information, but not too much:

1. we still don't know the possible values for `status` and what they represent;
2. we still don't know the possible values for `messageType`;
3. we know that `annotation` is nullable, but we still don't know when can it contain the `Annotation` structure.

<br />

The reality is that TypeScript includes a gradual typing system. There are many shades of type definitions. Some are wider, permissive, and encapsulate little information. Others are narrower, stricter, and provide lots of insights.

Now, if we encounter the above situation in real life, we don't have much of a choice but to analyze the code and figure out the possible values of those fields. Alternatively, we could ask our team mates that have been around longer and might recall the details.

So, let's improve the type definitions to convey more information about the data structure.

## Enums

Whenever we have to deal with a limited set of values, it's very helpful to define them separately:

```ts{11}
const MessageStatus = {
    Unsent: 0,
    Sent: 1,
    Deleted: 2,
} as const;

type MessageStatus = typeof MessageStatus[keyof typeof MessageStatus];

type Message = {
    // ... other fields
    status: MessageStatus, // 1️⃣
    messageType: string,
    annotation: Annotation | null,
}
```

The above declaration includes additional valuable information, regardless if we're familiar with the code or not. `MessageStatus` clearly documents what are the possible values for the `status` field and what they represent.

<Note>
  We could also use{" "}
  <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html">
    TypeScript Enums
  </a>{" "}
  as well, but for the purpose of this article, it doesn't matter which syntax
  is used to define them. The only relevant motivation for the above approach
  using plain JS objects is the{" "}
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/v22.14.0/api/typescript.html#typescript-features">
    type-stripping
  </a>{" "}
  feature added in Node.js 22, which encourages the usage of ECMAScript
  compliant syntax.
</Note>

## Literal Unions

An alternative to Enums is to define all possible values as an Union of literal types. This applies especially for `string` values, because they are self-explanatory and don't require an additional key to explain the value. For instance, we might deal with 2 types of messages:

```ts{6}
type MessageType = "text" | "annotation";

type Message = {
    // ... other fields
    status: MessageStatus,
    messageType: MessageType, // 2️⃣
    annotation: Annotation | null,
}
```

The above improvement answers our 2nd question above regarding the possible values for `messageType`.

<Note>
  Choosing between Enums or Unions is a matter of personal preferences. Both of
  them provide intellisense and autocomplete, both are type-safe, both work with
  rename refactoring tools. Enums work with both <code>number</code> or{" "}
  <code>string</code> types, while Literal Unions work better with{" "}
  <code>strings</code>.
</Note>

## Discriminated Unions

Whenever we are dealing with _different types of an object_, there's a good chance that their structures are slightly different, even if they have a lot of common fields. In such scenarios, a [discriminated union](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-func.html#discriminated-unions) is usually hiding, waiting to be discovered.

Another hint for discriminated unions, even when there's no obvious discriminant, is when we have data structures with a bunch of **optional or nullable fields**.

<br />

We can refactor the `Message` type as a union two different types, using the `messageType` as a discriminant:

```ts
type Message = TextMessage | AnnotationMessage;

type TextMessage = {
  // ... other fields
  messageType: "text";
  status: MessageStatus;
  annotation: null;
};

type AnnotationMessage = {
  // ... other fields
  messageType: "annotation";
  status: MessageStatus;
  annotation: Annotation;
};
```

Using the above discriminated union, we're answering the 3rd question above. The `annotation` is not really nullable. Instead, there are two types of `Messages`:

1. there's a `TextMessage` with no annotation;
2. and there's an `AnnotationMessage` that includes some `Annotation` data.

<br />

Discriminated unions provide valuable information about the entities and the relationships between them. Additionally, the typescript language service deeply understands them, providing great control flow analysis and [type narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#discriminated-unions).

## Explaining Type

Let's look at a different example of improving a type definition. In the below example, we have a Record type for storing the last read messages in order to display which messages are unread for each chat room. In practice, this is a key-value pair between a `chatRoomId` and a `messageId`.

```ts
type LastReadMessage = Record<number, number>;
```

However, the above code doesn't describe what those `number` type represent. A self-explanatory approach, without using code comments, is to extract the primitive `number` into 2 differently named type aliases to describe their nature:

```ts{3}
type ChatRoomId = number;
type MessageId = number;
type LastReadMessage = Record<ChatRoomId, MessageId>;
```

This type definition might seem useless, but it clearly explains the structure of the Record. This refactoring is similar to Martin Fowler's _Introducing Explaining Variable_, but at the primitive type level.
