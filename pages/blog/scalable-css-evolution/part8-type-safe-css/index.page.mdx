Before using TypeScript a few years ago, I never really thought about the limitations of plain CSS. In particular, the **lack of type checking** didn't bother me before. When using regular CSS code, CSS Modules or any CSS processors, no tools will tell us if we have any errors in the code we wrote without executing it.

To be honest, if I haven't started using TypeScript, I would probably still think that _CSS Modules paired with SCSS is all we need, because we can't do any better_. But I couldn't have been more wrong.

In this part, we will see how CSS-in-JS paired with TypeScript solves the missing piece of the puzzle in regard to UI development: **type safety for components' styles**.

## Typed design tokens

Design tokens defined in JavaScript that can be easily shared between logic and styles are very useful indeed. But **typed design tokens** defined in TypeScript are so much better. Consider this simple theme object:

<Side header={{ file: "theme.ts", lang: "TS" }}>

```ts{11}
export const theme = {
  colors: {
    brand: "#f45919",
    success: "#00875a",
    warning: "#f7b228",
    danger: "#de2362",
  },
  breakpoints: {
    /**/
  },
} as const;
```

</Side>

Using `as const` we're telling TypeScript that _"our `theme` object will never change, it is readonly"_. Thus, whenever we use the `theme` object:

- we get **auto-complete** for all of its properties, so we'll never have to remember them;
- we get instant **type-checking**, so we'll never misspell any of its properties.

<br />

<Side header={{ file: "component.tsx", lang: "TSX" }}>

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```tsx
import { theme } from "./theme";

// ❌ Property 'brandy' does not exist on type ...
theme.colors.brandy;
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

</Side>

## Typed props

Let's consider a `Notification` component that accepts a `color` prop. We could set its type to `string`, which is not wrong, but it's too permissive:

```tsx
interface NotificationProps {
  // ❌ too permissive
  color: string;
}
```

- component's consumers could pass any color, like `red` or `#ff0000`, which are not defined in our color palette;
- consumers will not know what colors should they use unless they manually look at the color palette definition.

<br />

Having our design tokens statically typed, we can further improve our UI components' interfaces. For example, we can hint our consumers what colors are available for the component:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```tsx
import { theme } from "./theme";

interface NotificationProps {
  // ✅ restricted only to defined colors
  color: keyof typeof theme.colors;
}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

- consumers will get [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) with all the available color options, so they don't have to remember or to type them manually;
- passing any other value will result in a compile-time error.

<br />

We can even go one step further, by allowing only a subset of colors, for specific use cases:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```tsx
import { theme } from "./theme";

interface NotificationProps {
  // ✅ restricted only to "success" & "danger"
  color: keyof Pick<typeof theme.colors, "success" | "danger">;
}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<br />

The sky is the limit regarding what can be achieved with TypeScript when authoring interfaces for UI components. **Any consumer of well-typed components will get a flawless experience during development.** It's virtually impossible to misuse such components.

## Safe refactorings

I can't stress enough the importance of refactorings, especially when we talk about scalable, long-term projects. Yet, we usually hesitate to refactor our code without proper tooling to provide **effortless but confident refactorings**. Thankfully, TypeScript is one of the tools that turn refactorings into enjoyable and trivial tasks.

<Subheading>
  <Status type="ok" />
  Manual refactorings
</Subheading>

Let's consider that we'll manually rename the `theme` object to `tokens`:

<Side header={{ file: "theme.ts", lang: "TS" }}>

```diff
- export const theme = { ... };
+ export const tokens = { ... };
```

</Side>

In this case, we'll get instant compile error(s) in all the files that import the old `theme` object. Thus, type checking will aid us in manually fixing all the problems without missing any occurrences, which is not possible with plain JavaScript.

```shell
# ✅ instant compile-time errors
Module '"./theme"' has no exported member 'theme'.
```

  Refactoring tools
</Subheading>

Renaming is one of the most common refactorings we usually perform. Using TypeScript, we can perform such refactorings automatically with proper tooling. For example, VSCode provides several [refactoring tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring), one of them being **rename symbol**.

Right-clicking the `theme` object, selecting **"Rename symbol"** from the dropdown, and choosing a new name like `tokens` will automatically update all imports and all usages of that object. What's left is to _Save all_ files, and we're done.

<Side header={{ file: "theme.ts", lang: "TS" }}>

```diff
- import { theme } from "./theme";
+ import { tokens } from "./theme";

  interface NotificationProps {
-   color: keyof typeof theme.colors;
+   color: keyof typeof tokens.colors;
  }
```

</Side>

### Renaming CSS classes

How often do we rename CSS classes due to updates in code that don't reflect what the class name refers to anymore? From my own experience, not that often. Without type-safety, manual refactorings are fragile and prone to errors.

So, instead of introducing potential bugs, we often choose not to perform CSS refactorings at all. This is unfortunate and problematic because the existing code will only worsen due to [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy), without any real possibility to improve it.

<Subheading>

  Renaming plain CSS classes
</Subheading>

Searching for a CSS class such `main-menu__item-link--active` to find its occurrences and rename them isn't that difficult, right? But what if its name is dynamically computed?

```js
const class_names = `main-menu__item-link${active ? "--active" : ""}`;
```

In this case, we would have a hard time finding out where the class is applied.

  Renaming CSS Modules classes
</Subheading>

With CSS Modules, we don't have to make sure the class names are unique, thanks to encapsulation. As a result, defined CSS classes tend to be shorter, like `.item` or `.active`. However, searching for such short and generic strings would usually end up with many results.

We'll have to manually discern which ones should be changed and which ones should be left untouched. Unfortunately, with CSS Modules, we cannot perform automatic renaming refactorings.

</Subheading>

With TypeScript and CSS-in-JS, we benefit from automatic refactorings out of the box, no matter which library we use. Moreover, even if we choose manual refactorings, we can rely on the type system to point out any potential errors without even running the code. That's a game-changer.

### Extracting components

Think about the last time you had to extract a component, along with its styles, into a separate file. How was the experience? How did you make sure that you have **moved all the required styles**, without missing any of them and leaving any styles behind that aren't needed anymore?

<Subheading>
  <Status type="err" />
  Type-unsafe extraction
</Subheading>

I can explain my personal experience as I've done in the past quite frequently:

1. I **search for all CSS classes**, static or dynamic, in the extracted component;
2. For each class, I **check if it's referenced in the old component** as well;
3. If it's not referenced, I would **move the class in the newly created `.css` file**;
4. **Repeat steps 2-3** for all CSS classes used in the extracted component;
5. Afterward, I run the application to **make sure I don't have any runtime errors**;
6. Perform a **visual check** to make sure that all styles are properly applied;
7. Sometimes, I would also have to **rename most CSS classes** to reflect the new name of the extracted component, which involves even more manual labor.

  Type-safe extraction
</Subheading>

With CSS-in-TypeScript, we have the type system as a sidekick, pointing out which styles need to be moved and which of them are not referenced anymore, so we can safely delete them. Extracting components couldn't be any safer than that.

As we've seen in the previous part, <LinkTo part={CURRENT_PART - 1}>CSS-in-JS</LinkTo> is very powerful, even on its own. But when paired with TypeScript, its power increases exponentially.

To conclude, TypeScript allows us to write **type-safe business logic**, TSX enables **type-safe markup**, and CSS-in-TypeScript provides **type-safe styles**. With these weapons at our disposal, scalability and maintainability become less problematic, regardless of the number of team members, the codebase's size, or the project's length.
