Phew, what a ride we had so far! During this series we've covered almost two decades of innovation regarding CSS authoring tools.

Since we're slowly approaching the current day, and also the end of this chronicle, it's time to take a step back, reflect on the knowledge we've gained, and draw some conclusions.

(end even dare to look inside the chrystal ball to see what the future of CSS tooling might look like)

Here's a brief summary of what we'll cover:

- Recap three different [**CSS authoring paradigms**](#paradigms), namely **Semantic CSS**, **Atomic CSS**, and **CSS-in-JS**;
- Analyze two different [**stylesheets loading techniques**](#techniques), such as **Static stylesheets** in contrast with **Dynamic stylesheets**;
- [Type-safety](#type-safety)
- Applicability [FAQs](#faqs)
- [Closing thoughts](#closing-thoughts)

## Paradigms

To simplify things, there are two paradigms that we can choose from: **semantic** or **atomic** CSS. We'll usually choose one of them as our main paradigm, but it's important to keep in mind that they're **not mutually exclusive**.

In practice, we'll most likely use both of them in an average `95% / 5%` ratio, regardless which one we use as the main paradigm. For instance:

- With Semantic CSS we'll surely use some [atomic utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/api/) like Bootstrap includes.
- Similarly, with Atomic CSS well have to use semantic classes to define styles for CSS Animations or certain pseudo-classes such as `::before` or `::after`.

### Semantic CSS

It's safe to say that <LinkTo part={4} hash="semantic-css">Semantic CSS</LinkTo> always was the de facto standard within the developers community. It promotes the usage of CSS class names that describe the meaning of the HTML element they represent, not their implementation. Such class names include `.card`, `.button`, or `.video-player` and contain all the required styles for that particular element. This approach creates a _clear separation between content and style_.

However, there are some things worthmentioning about Semantic CSS when we think about CSS maintainability and scalability:

- üòï The **CSS code will continually grow** as we add new features, which could potentially lead to large `.css` files. If they are frequently updated, caching doesn't help that much.
- üßê I dare to say that **CSS Modules** are essential for scaling and maintaining Semantic CSS. Without them, we'll have to address scalability issues using certain <LinkTo part={4}>CSS methodologies and architectures</LinkTo> which, as we saw, are not trivial to scale.
- üòâ We'll probably use a **CSS (pre) processors** as well for nesting and contextual styles.

### Atomic CSS

In contrast, <LinkTo part={5}>Atomic CSS</LinkTo> takes a totally different approach, fully embracing single purpose utility classes such as `.text-bold`, `.background-red-50`, or `.display-flex`. These classes explicitly describe their implementation and contain a single CSS rule.

- ü§© The CSS code will not grow indefinitely and the **total CSS size will be considerable lower** in comparison with Semantic CSS. It can also be cached for long periods of time, as it will rarely change.
- ü§® There will be an **increase in markup size**, as we'll need to attach more classes on HTML elements.
- üòå We **don't need other tools** for scaling CSS, since the paradigm itself addresses most scalability issues.
- üßê We'll have to **learn a framework**, unless we want to implement our own.

### CSS-in-JS

In highly interactive applications, where most of the styles are dynamically computed based on user actions, it makes sense to co-locate styles definitions next to the logic. If the styles depend solely on behaviour, separating them will only impede development and maintenance as well.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```js
// we'll use Goober as the CSS-in-JS library for this example
import { css } from "goober";

container.addEventListener("touchmove", (e) => {
  // a naive user interaction computation
  const xPos = e.touches[0].clientX;

  element.className = css({
    // dynamic styling üëá
    transform: `translateX(${xPos}px)`,

    // but also static styling üëç
    color: "#F45919",
  });
});
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Using a JavaScript framework, the syntax becomes less imperative. This is especially true for React, which has a highly declarative syntax, but also lacks a built-in scalable CSS authoring solution.

But nowadays CSS-in-JS usefulness is not limited to highly dynamic UIs:

</EmojiList>

<br />

Probably the most difficult and annoying aspect of CSS-in-JS is that there are more than 50 different libraries to choose from. **Picking one library is really difficult.** Not to mention that many of them are experimental or have been abandoned. Considering that we're working on a long-term project, choosing a solution that will still be maintained a few years from now is essential.

I've spent 2 months [thouroughly analizing most CSS-in-JS libraries](https://github.com/andreipfeiffer/css-in-js/blob/main/README.md#overview) so I personally know the pain. Hopefully, you can find useful information from the study.

## Techniques

So far, we've looked at CSS from the **authoring** perspective. Another angle we can explore is by analysing the **output and loading** of the stylesheets. Therefore, we have **static** and **dynamic** stylesheets, so let's dig a bit deeper.

### Static Stylesheets

Whether we're using Semantic or Atomic CSS, CSS processors, or CSS Modules, what we get in the end is one or more static `.css` files that we'll include in the `<head>` of our document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

<br />

Every single web developer has used this way to load CSS as this is the standard approach. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind:

- ü§ê By default, any `.css` file included in the document `<head>` is a [rendering blocking resource](https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/). Depending on the filesize, compression ratio, network conditions, server response time, latency, user bandwidth and CPU power, downloading a `.css` file could degrade the [Speed Index](https://web.dev/speed-index/) or the page.

  [Extracting critical CSS](https://web.dev/extract-critical-css/) aka. _above-the-fold CSS_ is a solution, but not a trivial one to implement, especially with dynamic websites and applications.

- ü§î CSS files are cached are **easily cached** by the browser, which prevents unnecessary requests for the same file. However, this brings no benefit if any style change invalidates the entire CSS file. Frequent changes defeats the purpose of caching.

- üòá Content and styling are strictly separated. This means we can **update content without invalidating CSS cache**, being highly beneficial during Server-Side Rendering.

- üòü On the other hand, the initially loaded `.css` file **must contain all the required dynamic styles** that might be triggered by user events, unless we lazy-load them at runtime.

### Dynamic Stylesheets

Whenever there we have to deal with user interaction, we'll probably need to update some styles as well. Some basic examples might be adding, removing, or toggling CSS classes from event handlers defined in JavaScript.

However, when the styling depends on **user behaviour**, we cannot pre-generate all of them to be included in the `.css` file. This occurs during complex user events such as **dragging**, **pinching**, or **selecting arbitrary styling values** such as a color picker. To implement such styling, we'll have to fully switch to JavaScript:

```js
// attach event handler
container.addEventListener("touchmove", (e) => {
  // a naive user interaction computation
  const xPos = e.touches[0].clientX;

  // dynamic styling üëá
  element.style.transform = `translateX(${xPos}px)`;
});
```

<br />

We might argue that with component-based architectures, managing styles based on user behaviour could become convoluted. Having the static styles defined in `.css` files and the dynamic styles in `.js` files could get tricky in certain types of applications, like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

This is where a new paradigm makes its entrance.

## Type-safety

The primary reason for conducting the aforementioned study of CSS-in-JS libraries was to find a way to get **styling type-checking**. When we think about code scalability and long term maintainability, type-safety plays an essential role that shouldn't be overlooked.

As front-end/UI developers, we got used to the lack the type-safety because of JavaScript and CSS. We all know the fear of refactoring. We don't touch existing code because we don't know what might brake. But this lack of confidence impedes any effort in maintaining our code and fighting software entropy.

Unfortunately, the only current way to benefit from type-safety in CSS is to adopt CSS-in-JS. Or should I say **CSS-in-TypeScript**, because we need a static type checker, like TypeScript or Flow.

Once we're comfortable with TypeScript, we get gradual benefits, depending on the level of safety we're looking for:

- üß≠ code navigation tools embedded in most editors and IDEs to quickly go to styles definition or find their usage.
- üß∞ refactoring tools to aid us in renaming, extracting, and moving code around. Code refactoring has never been easier.
- üîî instant type-checking for unused definitions or misspelled identifiers, which is undoubtedly a game changer.
- üîê the option to implement typed design tokens or typed component variants, enforcing strong contracts between the component's logic and it's styles.

## FAQs

1. Why is CSS-in-JS not popular and widely used? - conservative, we stick to what we've invested in so far
2. What about design systems? - they're complex tools, built on to of techniques described here
3. ... we believe it's "normal" what we grow up with. those who grew up with "semantics" will believe that's normal. if we would teach someone css-in-js or atomic css, they would believe that's the normal. it's only a matter of perspective.
4. Do we need to learn all the techniques presented here? - No, we don't _need_ to, but it _helps_ to know they exist. Understading _how_ and _when_ a particular tool or technique is applicable will only enrich our knowledge, allowing us to make educated technical decisions.

## Closing thoughts

I've spent a reasonable amount of time asking myself why are we so divided as a community. A simple explanation would be that we have different needs, therefore we require different tools.

But there's another explanation I'm debating lately, which analyzes our own evolution as software developers. I remember [Kent Beck's quote](https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast):

> Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast.

There are many interpretations for this statement. One of them is to 1Ô∏è‚É£ get the code working correctly, don't optimize prematurely, 2Ô∏è‚É£ refactor the code, clean it up, 3Ô∏è‚É£ and lastly optimize it for performance.

<br />

Here's my own interpretation of Kent Beck's quote in the larger context of scalable and maintainable CSS:

<Subheading>1Ô∏è‚É£ Make it work</Subheading>

In the beginning, we struggle with learning the CSS language iself and the tools, techniques and practices described in this chronicle. We don't think a lot about _"what's scalable or optimal"_. Our only focus is to make the code do what it's supposed to do. We're concerned only for the short term and we mostly think about our own code. At this stage, any CSS paradigm or technique we choose or work with will do the job.

<Subheading>2Ô∏è‚É£ Make it right</Subheading>

At some point we get comfortable with the technicalities. We can easily make it work. Thus, we can turn our attention to longer term concerns, like _"how do I make it extensible, scalable, or maintainable"_. At this stage, we can debate what tools and techniques can aid us on the long term. Our main focus shifts from ourselves to our team.

<Subheading>3Ô∏è‚É£ Make it fast</Subheading>

After a while we'll get to try various approaches, experience the pros and cons, understand where each of them shine. When the code maintainability and scalability problems are dealt with, we can finally turn our attention to performance. We shift the focus from the team, to the users. At this stage, we debate _what tools and approaches work best for our users_. We're already comfortable using any approach, but we understand that choosing a specific paradigm or technique will be more beneficial for our end users.

<br />

In practice, "our own evolution" is not a linear timeline. Everytime we learn something new, we get back to step 1. Sometimes we jump from step 1 directly to step 3, because it's required. Other times we don't even get the step 3 at all.

In the end, the work we're doing is called [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering#Definition) which is defined as:

> The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop [...]

Therefore, it's expected from us to analyze, design, build and maintain according to our project goals. Since we're not all working on the same project, we have different goals. It's obvious that we're all unique.

- make educated decisions, don't always rely on the status quo
- learn from others, build upon other's work, that's how science evolved
- discern between old teachings that are still valid today, and the ones that were valid in the context of their definition ... thus, if the context changed, the "rule" doesn't apply anymore
