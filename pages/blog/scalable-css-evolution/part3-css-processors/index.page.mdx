In the previous article, <LinkTo part={CURRENT_PART - 1} />, we've covered several essential techniques that help us write more maintainable CSS. They represent the first tactics used in the fight against scalability problems.

In this part, we'll turn our attention to the first tools that addressed CSS maintainability issues, namely **CSS processors**. There are two categories, each of them serving different purposes:

- [**CSS preprocessors**](#css-preprocessing) introduce support for contextual styles, removing a lot of the source code duplication.
- [**CSS postprocessors**](#css-postprocessing) optimize the final CSS output while paving the way for future tools that we'll touch upon in later chapters.

<Note>
  The separation between "pre" and "post" processors is not that clear nowadays
  because most modern tools perform both pre and post-processing. Therefore it's
  better to simply call them all <strong>CSS processors</strong>.
  <br />
  <br />
  In this article, I'm sticking with the improper <em>de facto</em> naming to distinguish
  between the two categories of tools because that's how they're colloquially known.

## CSS preprocessing

There was a time when _CSS variables_ or _CSS math functions_ like `calc()` were not implemented natively in browsers. Nowadays, they are considered de-facto standard in front-end development, being well supported for years.

However, before we had full browser support for such useful features, we had to rely on alternative methods. That's when the age of **CSS preprocessors** began.

Any **CSS authoring tool** that uses **non-standard CSS syntax**, allowing developers to write code more comfortably and **outputs valid CSS** code, could be considered a **CSS preprocessor**.

- [**SASS**](https://sass-lang.com/) was the first one, released in 2006;
- [**LESS**](https://lesscss.org/) was the second one, released in 2009;
- [**Stylus**](https://stylus-lang.com/) followed along in 2010.

<br />

Come to think about it, many CSS preprocessors features are focused on **avoiding code duplication**. For instance, _variables_ allow us to re-use concrete values, while _mixins_ enable us to re-use entire blocks of CSS rules.

CSS preprocessors also introduced numerous additional features such as _nesting_, _interpolation_, _conditionals_, _operators_, _functions_, and much more. We won't go into their details, as most of them are outside the scope of this article.

However, there are two particular features that we're interested in, which completely changed the way we author CSS styles even today, namely **nesting** and **parent selector**, as they enable **contextual styles** definition.

### Contextual styles

**Nesting** allows us to define CSS rules for a selector inside another selector, simplifying descendant declarations. In addition, the **parent selector** enables us to refer to the outer selector during nesting.

Combining these two features, we can easily avoid the <LinkTo part={1} hash="selector-duplication">selector duplication</LinkTo> issue that we've previously covered:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<SideBySide left={{lang: "CSS", file: "styles.css"}} right={{lang: "SCSS", file: "style.scss"}}>

```css
.product_title {}

/* ðŸ¤Œ verbose duplication with plain CSS */
.product_title:hover {}
.product_title::after {}
```

```scss
/* ðŸ‘Œ single source of truth with SCSS */
.product_title {
  
  &:hover {}
  &::after {}
}
```

</SideBySide>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Contextual styles provide obvious conveniences during development: we write less code when defining selectors, and we group related styles.

Nevertheless, other obscure benefits also surface during long-term maintenance:

- **renaming selectors is straightforward** because they're defined only once;
- code is **easy to understand** because all pseudo-classes and elements are colocated;
- **deleting code is trivial** because all related elements are grouped together.

<Subheading>Maintainable media queries</Subheading>

Another major benefit of contextual styles is that media queries could also be nested inside their respective selector:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<SideBySide left={{lang: "CSS", file: "styles.css"}} right={{lang: "SCSS", file: "style.scss"}}>

```css
.product_title {}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .product_title {}
}

@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  .product_title {}
}
```

```scss
.product_title {

  @media (min-width: 768px) {}

  @media (min-width: 1280px) {}
}
```

</SideBySide>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

With contextual styles, all definitions related to a particular selector are grouped within a single code block. Even though _UI components_ were not _a thing_ back then, CSS preprocessors introduced a syntax that enabled that mindset.

<br />

Nowadays, **contextual styles are widely used in most CSS-in-JS libraries**, either supporting the parent selector `&` or using some custom syntax that provides the same behavior.

Therefore, CSS preprocessors played a crucial role in the evolution of scalable CSS.

## CSS postprocessing

In contrast with preprocessors, postprocessors don't typically add new CSS syntax. Instead, they receive regular CSS as input.

Any tool that transforms **valid CSS code**, either by **improving or optimizing** it, can be considered a **CSS postprocessor**. There used to be numerous CSS postprocessors, but lately, they seem to have converged to a single tool.

[**PostCSS**](https://postcss.org/) was released in 2013. It's still maintained today and is by far the most popular tool for CSS postprocessing. **PostCSS** includes over 300 [plugins](https://www.postcss.parts/) that we can combine and automate. I'll mention only a couple of popular ones:

- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) automates the process of adding vendor-specific prefixes to the required CSS rules, allowing us to author CSS using the standard syntax.
<!-- - [combine-media-query](https://github.com/SassNinja/postcss-combine-media-query) which removes duplication of media queries, considerably reducing the `.css` file size. -->
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) is a modern linter that highlights CSS errors and enforces conventions in our styles, including [specificity limiters](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/list/selector-max-specificity).

<Subheading>Paving the way for CSS Modules</Subheading>

PostCSS is widely used today either as a separate tool or working under the hood for many other libraries and frameworks.

One thing worth mentioning is that PostCSS opened the doors for <LinkTo part={6} hash="css-modules">CSS Modules</LinkTo>, which started as a [PostCSS plugin](https://github.com/markdalgleish/postcss-local-scope-example) experiment. We'll cover CSS Modules in more detail in later chapters, as they played a critical role within the CSS ecosystem.

---

To recap, CSS processors are essential tools, widely used even today. Moreover, they are cornerstones in the evolution of scalable CSS. Preprocessors introduced **contextual styles**, while postprocessors provided the foundation for **styles encapsulation** covered in later chapters.

In the next part of this series, **<LinkTo part={CURRENT_PART + 1} />**, we'll explore several approaches to organize CSS code, consisting of structured and cohesive sets of rules.
