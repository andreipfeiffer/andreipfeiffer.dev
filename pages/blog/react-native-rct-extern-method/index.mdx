Most of the Objective-C Macros from React Native that you have to use when bridging native code are self-explanatory and easy to use. But there is something weird about **RCT_EXTERN_METHOD** at first sight.

It took me quite some time to understand how it works. There’s no detailed documentation about this, so I will try my best to explain it.

---

As the name implies, these Macros enable us to expose a native method to React Native’s bridge. It has the following syntax:

```
RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(
  methodName:         (paramType1)internalParamName1
  externalParamName2: (paramType2)internalParamName2
  externalParamName3: (paramType3)internalParamName3
  ...
)
```

Probably the easiest way to understand it is from some examples:

## Example with no arguments

```
// Obj-C
RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(getCount)

// Swift
func getCount() {...}
```

This is the most simple example. When your method has no arguments, all you need to do is specify the method name.

## Example with 1 argument

```
// Obj-C
RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(getCount:(NSString)name)

// Swift
func getCount(_ name: NSString) {...}
```

There are 3 things going on here:

1. The external name of the argument (`getCount`), maps to the **Swift method name**;
2. The internal name of the argument (`name`) maps to the corresponding **Swift argument**;
3. Since the argument doesn’t have an external name, we use `"_"` instead.

## Example with 2 (or more) arguments

<Code>


// Obj-C
RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(getCount:(NSString)name withAge:(NSNumber)age)

// Swift
func getCount(\_ name: NSString, withAge age: NSNumber)

</Code>


For the 1st argument, the above rules apply. Starting with the second argument, the external and internal names map as we would expect:
