Have you ever wondered _**why it takes minutes to install npm dependencies on your CI server, even when they should be fully cached?**_ We have experienced such an issue, taking more than **`6 minutes`** to install the npm dependencies, even when they haven't changed between builds, and being fully cached by the CI service.

This short post will analyze a case study to detect slow dependencies during installation and debug the source of the problem.

## Case study

Before diving into the problem, let's describe our context to understand the premises:

- We currently use continuous integration (CI) to install dependencies and create the production build.
- We're using **npm** for dependencies management.
- We're executing **`npm ci --production`** to install dependencies on the CI.
- We have properly set up the **cache folder** for npm on CodeShip.

<Note>
  The{" "}
  <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-ci">
    <code>npm ci</code>
  </a>{" "}
  command performs a clean install, deleting any existing{" "}
  <code>node_modules</code> folder and installing dependencies based solely on
  the exact versions found in the <code>package-lock.json</code> file.
  <br />
  <br />
  Additionally, the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install#see-also:~:text=With%20the%20%2D%2Dproduction%20flag">
    <code>--production</code>
  </a> flag will skip installing <code>devDependencies</code>, which for us was a
  micro-optimization.
</Note>

We've noticed that the dependencies install time was surprisingly high, around 6 minutes. However, when the dependencies are cached and haven't changed from the previous build, they should have been copied from the cache, resulting in short install times.

## Detecting slow dependencies

To get to the root of the problem, we needed a way to tap into the npm installation process and collect some cold metrics. My colleague [Nicu Surdu](https://surdu.me/) found a neat package called [**`slow-deps`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slow-deps) built by [Nolan Lawson](https://nolanlawson.com/), which is a:

> CLI to measure which dependencies in a project are the slowest to npm install.

Running `npx slow-deps` on the repository will output the install time for all dependencies in `package.json`, sorted from slowest to fastest:

```md{9}
$ npx slow-deps

npx: installed 86 in 15.755s
Analyzing 170 dependencies...

---------------------------------------------------------------
| Dependency                    | Time     | Size    |   Deps |
---------------------------------------------------------------
| react-toolbox                 | 7m 42.9s | 4.6 MB  |     12 |
| react-scripts                 | 1m 12.8s | 149 MB  |   1037 |
| @storybook/react              | 1m  5.9s | 133 MB  |    791 |
| @storybook/addon-essentials   |    56.0s | 141 MB  |    816 |
| craco-esbuild                 |    16.2s |  34 MB  |    201 |
| cypress                       |    10.0s |  17 MB  |    157 |
# ...
```

In our case, the output appalled us: one of the smallest packages, with only `4.6MB`, took the longest time to install: `7m 42.9s`. `react-toolbox` is an old and discontinued components library for React, which we used in our project.

Now the question was, _what is so special about `react-toolbox`_?

## The problem

So far, we know what exactly is causing the problem, but we don't know why. So another one of my colleagues, [Cristian Diaconescu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristian-diaconescu-023a752b/), took a peek at our `package.json` file, where he discovered something interesting.

Apparently, `react-toolbox` was **installed directly from a github repository**, not from the npm registry. The reason for this is that the package was abandoned in the past, so we had to fork it and maintain our own version of the library.

```json{8}
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@storybook/addon-essentials": "6.4.8",
    "@storybook/react": "6.4.8",
    "craco-esbuild": "0.5.0",
    "cypress": "9.5.0",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3",
    "react-toolbox": "github:********/react-toolbox#9d38c6"
  }
}
```

<br />

Now, there are 2 potential problems here:

1. First of all, **npm didn't cache the dependency**. Subsequent installs should have been quite fast, regardless of how long the first download takes.
2. Secondly, **downloading the package is way too slow**. This could indicate a problem with the Github repository.

As we couldn't find any documentation regarding the lack of caching for dependencies loaded directly from Github, we took a deeper look at the second problem.

<Subheading>Verbose logs</Subheading>

Cristi also ran a verbose npm install to get more details regarding what's happening during the installation of the package:

```bash
npm install -ddd
# -ddd flag outputs the most verbose log
```

Searching for something meaningful, we've found an intriguing clue in the output:

```text
[...]
Retrying git command: ls-remote -h -t git://github.com/********/react-toolbox.git attempt # 2
Retrying git command: ls-remote -h -t git://github.com/********/react-toolbox.git attempt # 3
git manifest for react-toolbox@github:********/react-toolbox#9d38c6 fetched in 394569ms
[...]
```

<Subheading>Repository url protocol</Subheading>

There were some failed attempts to read the repository using `git ls-remote` command. A third colleague, namely [Florin Sarghe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florinsarghe/), ran the same command in isolation, confirming that, indeed, this was the bottleneck:

```bash
> git ls-remote -h -t git://github.com/********/react-toolbox.git

# ðŸš« fatal: unable to connect to github.com: errno=Operation timed out
```

<br />

Notice that we used the **`git://` protocol** for the repository url. However, Florin also discovered that running the same command, but using the **`https` protocol** instead, resulted in an instant response:

```bash
> git ls-remote -h -t https://github.com/********/react-toolbox.git

# âœ… instant response
```

### Optimization

Fortunately, we didn't share the library across multiple projects in different repositories. Therefore, we could **move the entire library inside our repository** since it was already forked and maintained internally.

Surprisingly, after this simple refactoring, we have witnessed a huge speed boost, from more than `6:30 minutes` down to `30 seconds`, as we expected in the first place.

## Takeaways

In case you're experiencing slow npm install command, locally or on your CI, there are some easy ways to debug potential bottlenecks:

- Run **`npx slow-deps`** on your repository to get an idea regarding which packages are slow to install.
- Use **`npm install -ddd`** if you need verbose logs and timings during the installation process.
- In case you're using git urls for the slow dependencies with the `git://` protocol, try switching to **`https://`**.
- Use `git ls-remote -h -t <repository-url>` to confirm that the optimization actually worked.
