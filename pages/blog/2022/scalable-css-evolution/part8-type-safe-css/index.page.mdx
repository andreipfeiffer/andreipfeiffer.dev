<!-- Before using TypeScript a few years ago, I never really thought about the limitations of plain CSS. In particular, the **lack of type checking** didn't bother me before. When using regular CSS code, CSS Modules or any CSS processors, no tools will tell us if we have any errors in the code we wrote without executing it.

To be honest, if I haven't started using TypeScript, I would probably still think that _CSS Modules paired with SCSS is all we need, because we can't do any better_. But I couldn't have been more wrong. -->

In the previous article of this series, <LinkTo part={CURRENT_PART - 1} />, we've covered a third paradigm, bsides Semantic CSS and Atomic styles definition. Depending on the specific CSS-in-JS library, we could output styles either dynamically or statically, either as atomic classes or semantic encapsulated classes.

In this part, we'll take CSS-in-JS one step forward, pairing it with TypeScript to solve the missing piece of the puzzle regarding type-safe UI development: **type safety for components' styles**.

<br />

Here's what we'll cover:

- [**What is type safety?**](#what-is-type-safety), especially in the context of CSS.
- [**Typed themes**](#typed-themes) for design systems.
- [**Typed interfaces**](#typed-interfaces) for UI components design.
- [**Safe refactorings**](#safe-refactorings) either manual or using specialized tools.

## What is type safety?

User interface development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript lacks type safety by default. Browser engines are built to ignore most errors and make a best effort to render whatever they can. This means that developers cannot rely on tools to highlight potential problems in their code, so they have to be extra cautious during development. This becomes a scalability problem during long term projects.

Firstly, CSS is not a programming language per se, therefore it doesn't have its own compiler to check for code errors. Instead, CSS makes sense when applied to HTML content, either as static or dynamically manipulated styles using JavaScript.

So let's cover a few categories of **type errors** that could surface when writing CSS code and see how we could prevent them.

<Subheading>Invalid CSS properties or values</Subheading>

Most code editors include support for CSS, providing suggestions, code completion, and validating CSS rules and their respective values. But if we want to check the correctness of the code, we'd have to use linters such as [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) to enforce valid syntax.

```css
.notification {
  /* üö´ incorrect CSS rule & value */
  font-thickness: big;
}
```

CSS-in-JS libraries that implement Object Syntax for styles definition typically use [CSSType](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csstype) to provide type definitions for static type checkers like TypeScript or Flow.

<Subheading>Mispelled CSS variables</Subheading>

Using nested CSS custom properties or invalid CSS variables are too complex to analyze. It's highly unlikely to detect such errors with linters of other static analysis tools. Not to mention that any markup or style can be manipulated at runtime. Therefore, browsers will silently ignore any non-existent CSS variables.

```css
.notification {
  /* üö´ incorrect CSS custom property name */
  color: var(--color-missing);
}
```

With CSS-in-JS we use plain JavaScript variables, which have to exist at compile time to reference them, making them trivial to type check.

<Subheading>Mispelled or missing CSS classes</Subheading>

When applying CSS classes to HTML elements we might misspell them, or specify a missing class. On the other hand, we could delete a CSS class that's still used somewhere in the code. There are no tools, at least for now, to prevent such type errors.

For CSS modules there's a [TypeScript language service plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-plugin-css-modules) that checks if the applied class names are defined in the imported CSS files. However, it has its limitations and it doesn't support refactoring.

```html
 <!-- üö´ misspelled CSS class name -->
<div class="notification_item">
```

Since CSS-in-JS solutions work with JS/TS identifiers instead of untyped strings, type checking is trivial since it's performed by the JavaScript language service, or by the respective static type checker in the case of TypeScript or Flow.

<Note title="Code Completion vs. Type Checking" uppercase={false}>
  Most code editors and IDEs provide{" "}
  <strong>code completion, suggestions, and IntelliSense</strong> for CSS rules and valid values, either by
  default or via plugins. Such features are helpful when writing code as we don't have to manually type the entire code ourselves.<br /><br />
  However, when we make any changes, a <strong>type checker</strong> is required to
  re-validate the correctness of the updated code. A common scenario is when changing a component's interface that is used in multiple places. A type checker would throw errors, while code completion alone would have no effect.
</Note>

Using CSS-in-JS, paired with a static type checker, unlocks the power of type safety for CSS code, preventing a large class of errors to reach production code. Additionaly, static types also enable **better component interface design**, but also **trivial refactorings** which are essential during long-term code maintenance.

## Typed themes

Design tokens defined in JavaScript, that can be easily <LinkTo part={1} hash="shared-variables">shared between logic and styles</LinkTo>, are very useful especially when working with design systems. We could define an entire theme using a plain JavaScript object:

<Side header={{ file: "theme.ts", lang: "TS" }}>

```ts
export const theme = {
  colors: {
    brand: "#f45919",
    success: "#00875a",
    warning: "#f7b228",
  },
  breakpoints: {
    /*...*/
  },
};
```

</Side>

The theme can be easily shared across an entire application by explicitly importing it:

<Side header={{ file: "component.ts", lang: "TSX" }}>

```tsx
import { css } from "css-in-js-library";
import { theme } from "./theme";

const styles = css({
  background: theme.colors.success
});

export const Notification = () => (
  <div className={styles}>...</div>
);
```

</Side>

- we get **auto complete** for all of its properties, so we'll never have to remember them;
- we get instant **type checking**, so we'll never misspell any of its properties.

<br />

<Code>
  <span>theme.colors.warning</span>
  <br />
  <span className="token comment">// ‚úÖ "#f7b228"</span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>theme.colors.<Err>warn</Err></span>
  <br />
  <span className="token comment">// ‚ùå Property 'warn' does not exist</span>
</Code>

Additionally, type checking also kicks in whenever someone changes the definition of the `theme`. Without having to search for all occurrences, the type system will highlight them, guiding us in solving all type errors.

## Typed interfaces

Let's consider a `Notification` component that accepts a `color` prop. We could set its type to `string`. It's not wrong, however, it might be too permissive:

```tsx
interface NotificationProps {
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è too permissive
  color: string;
}
```

- Component's **authors** would have to implement manual checks to validate the input and allow only accepted values.
- Component's **consumers** could pass any color, like `red` or `#ff0000`, which are not defined in our color theme. They will not know what colors are valid unless they manually look at the color palette definition or understand the component's source code.

<br />

With statically defined themes, we can further improve our UI components' interfaces. Adding an `as const` type assertion, we're telling TypeScript that _"our `theme` object is readonly and will never change"_.

<Side header={{ file: "theme.ts", lang: "TS" }}>

```ts{3}
export const theme = {
  /*...*/
} as const;
```

</Side>

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

Now, we can hint our consumers what colors are available for the component:

```tsx
import { theme } from "./theme";

interface NotificationProps {
  // ‚úÖ restricted only to defined colors
  color: keyof typeof theme.colors;
}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

- **Consumers** will get [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) with all the available color options, so they don't have to remember or to type them manually.
- The **authors** don't have to implement any additional checks, as the type system would throw compile-time errors when passing invalid input.
- Last but not least, **typed code is self documented**, therefore understanding what the code does becomes trivial.

<br />

We can even go one step further, by allowing only a subset of colors, for specific use cases:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```tsx
import { theme } from "./theme";

interface NotificationProps {
  // ‚úÖ restricted only to "success" & "warning"
  color: keyof Pick<typeof theme.colors, "success" | "warning">;
}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

And the best part is that everything is interconnected. Whenever we change the `theme.colors` object and rename or remove one of the colors, all component interfaces and all consumers that use those components will throw compile errors, highlighting the problems that we need fix.

<br />

With strictly typed interfaces, any component consumer will get a **flawless development experience**, without having to fully understand the implementation details. Misusing such components is very unlikely, since the type system validates the consumer input, while also providing hints for the correct usage.

## Safe refactorings

During long-term projects, refactoring becomes an essential practice. However, without proper tooling to support **effortless and confident refactorings**, we might be relunctant in changing any working code. Thankfully, TypeScript is one of the tools that turn refactorings into trivial tasks we can perform on a daily basis.

<Subheading>
  <Status type="ok" />
  Manual refactorings
</Subheading>

Let's consider that we'll manually rename the `theme` object to `tokens`:

<Side header={{ file: "theme.ts", lang: "TS" }}>

```diff
- export const theme = { ... };
+ export const tokens = { ... };
```

</Side>

In this case, we'll get instant compile error(s) in all the files that import the old `theme` object. Thus, type checking will aid us in manually fixing all the problems without missing any occurrences.

```shell
# ‚úÖ instant compile-time errors
Module '"./theme"' has no exported member 'theme'.
```

With plain JavaScript, this particular error would occur during transpilation, so it would be instant with [HMR](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/).

<br />

But what is we change the name of a specific theme color?

<Side header={{ file: "theme.ts", lang: "TS" }}>

```diff
  export const theme = {
    colors: {
-     brand: "#f45919",
+     primary: "#f45919",
    },
  };
```

</Side>

In the case of TypeScript, we'll also get instant compile-time errors, highlighting all the occurences that we need to replace.

```shell
# ‚úÖ instant compile-time errors
Property 'brand' does not exist.
```

With plain JavaScript on the other hand, this particular error would occur only at runtime, once that particular code will be executed. Unfortunately, it could slip away without even noticing it, surfacing unexpentedly at a later time.

<Subheading>
  <Status type="ok" />
  Refactoring tools
</Subheading>

Renaming is one of the most common refactorings we usually perform. Using TypeScript, we can perform such refactorings automatically with proper tooling. For example, VSCode provides several [refactoring tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring), one of them being **rename symbol**.

Right-clicking the `theme` object, selecting **"Rename symbol"** from the dropdown, and choosing a new name like `tokens` will automatically update all imports and all usages of that object. What's left is to _Save all_ files, and we're done.

<Side header={{ file: "theme.ts", lang: "TS" }}>

```diff
- import { theme } from "./theme";
+ import { tokens } from "./theme";
```

</Side>

<Side header={{ file: "Notification.tsx", lang: "TSX" }}>

```diff
  interface NotificationProps {
-   color: keyof typeof theme.colors;
+   color: keyof typeof tokens.colors;
  }
```

</Side>

### Renaming CSS classes

Since CSS classes are typically handled as strings, there are no refactoring tools available for us to support automatic renaming. On the other hand, manual renaming is quite error prone, since it's not trivial to determine all the usages of a single CSS class or selector.

So, instead of introducing potential bugs, we often choose not to perform CSS refactorings at all. This is unfortunate and problematic because the existing code will only worsen due to [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy), without any real option to improve it.

<Subheading>
  <Status type="err" />
  Semantic CSS classes
</Subheading>

Searching for a CSS class such `main-menu__item-link--active` to find its occurrences and rename them isn't that difficult, right? But what if its name is dynamically computed?

```js
const class_names = `main-menu__item-link${active ? "--active" : ""}`;
```

In this case, we would have a hard time finding out where the class is applied.

With CSS Modules it gets a bit easier, since we tipically have a single file per component. However, when working with large components, the same limitations apply.

<Subheading>
  <Status type="ok" />
  CSS-in-TS styles
</Subheading>

With TypeScript and CSS-in-JS, we benefit from automatic refactorings out of the box, no matter which library we use. Moreover, even if we perform manual refactorings, we can rely on the type system to point out any potential errors without even running the code.

### Extracting components

Without type safety, extracting a component along with its styles into a separate file is a daunting task. That might be the reason why we're relunctant to perform such refactorings.

The most challenging task during component extraction is making sure that we have **moved all the required styles**, without leaving any styles behind that aren't needed anymore.

<Subheading>
  <Status type="err" />
  Type-unsafe extraction
</Subheading>

Let's go step by step through a manual process of component extraction. Considering we have already extracted the markup and logic into a separate file, we have to to the same for all the used styles:

1. First, we have to **search for all CSS classes**, static or dynamic, used by the extracted component.
2. For each class, we have to **check if it's referenced in the old component** as well.
3. If it's not referenced, we could **move the class in the newly created `.css` file**. Otherwise, we must figure out how to share it between the two components.
4. We'll have to **repeat steps 2-3** for all CSS classes used in the extracted component.
5. Afterward, we have to run the application **making sure we don't have any runtime errors**.
6. Perform a **visual check** to make sure that all styles are properly applied.
7. Sometimes, we also have to **rename CSS classes** to reflect the new name of the extracted component, which involves even more manual labor.

<Subheading>
  <Status type="ok" />
  Type-safe extraction
</Subheading>

With CSS-in-TypeScript, we have the type system as a sidekick, pointing out which styles need to be moved and which of them are not referenced anymore, so we can safely delete them. Extracting components couldn't be any safer than that.

---

Static type checkers like TypeScript have an increasing adoption in web development, allowing us to write **type-safe business logic**. Additionaly, TSX enables **type-safe JSX markup**, being officially supported by TypeScript. Finally, CSS-in-TypeScript provides **type-safe styles**.

With these weapons at our disposal, scalability and maintainability become less problematic, regardless of the number of team members, the codebase's size, or the project's length.

As we're slowly approaching the present day, before ending the chronicle let's take a step back and synthesize in the **<LinkTo part={CURRENT_PART + 1} />** everything that we've covered so far.
