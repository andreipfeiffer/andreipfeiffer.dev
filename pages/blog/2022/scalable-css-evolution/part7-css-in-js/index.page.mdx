In the previous part of this series, <LinkTo part={CURRENT_PART - 1} />, we've covered an alternative paradigm to CSS authoring, using a predefined set of single-purpose utility classes that we reference in HTML. This paradigm removes the majority of scalability issues associated with Semantic CSS.

During this part, we'll cover a third paradigm, introduced around the same period as Atomic CSS. Instead of using `.css` files for style definition, **CSS-in-JS** moves the definition inside `.js` files, colocating the component's styles with its markup and behavior.

<br />

We won't be analyzing any particular library as their APIs differ quite a bit. Instead, we'll focus on typical CSS-in-JS approaches' fundamental principles and key features to understand the underlying technology. Here's what we'll cover next:

- The [**Origins**](#origins) of CSS-in-JS;
- [**The basics**](#the-basics) of defining styles and applying them to elements;
- Granular [**dead code elimination**](#dead-code-elimination);
- Trivial [**variables sharing**](#shared-variables) between styles and JS code;
- Effortless [**code navigation**](#code-navigation) using editor tooling;
- [**Static CSS extraction**](#static-css-extraction);
- [**Atomic CSS-in-JS**](#atomic-css-in-js).

## Origins

It might come as a surprise, but the idea of _"styling with JavaScript"_ is not as novel as many would believe.

In 1996, Netscape implemented **JSSS**, aka. [JavaScript-Based Style Sheets](https://www.w3.org/Submission/1996/1/WD-jsss-960822) as an alternative to CSS. Netscape even submitted the specification to W3C for standardization. However, it didn't gain enough traction, as ["CSS had a much wider industry acceptance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Style_Sheets#:~:text=Netscape%20stopped%20promoting%20JSSS%2C%20instead%20focusing%20on%20the%20rival%20CSS%20standard%2C%20which%20was%20also%20supported%20by%20Internet%20Explorer%20and%20had%20a%20much%20wider%20industry%20acceptance). Ultimately, in 2000, Netscape dropped all support for JSSS.

### The birth of CSS-in-JS

<!-- Before jumping into the main content, I think it's imperative to answer the question _"Why does CSS in JavaScript even exist?"_ to understand its purpose in this world. -->

CSS-in-JS, as it is known today, was coined in 2014. There are two known pioneers of CSS-in-JS, namely [Christopher Chedeau](http://blog.vjeux.com/2014/javascript/react-css-in-js-nationjs.html) from Facebook and [Oleg Isonen](https://oleg008.medium.com/the-important-parts-131dda7f6f6f), the author of JSS (not to be confused with Netscape's JSSS from 1996).

We need to recollect that CSS Modules or other popular style encapsulation approaches were not available at that time. Atomic CSS frameworks were around, but quite exotic and unpopular.

<br />

Therefore, **_CSS-in-JS is fundamentally an alternative solution to solve the problems of scalable CSS_**. As a consequence, there is a considerable amount of overlap between CSS-in-JS and the other approaches covered in previous chapters:

- **Styles encapsulation** is a core feature of any CSS-in-JS library. CSS Modules played an essential role by [popularizing CSS class hashing](https://youtu.be/75kmPj_iUOA?t=719), a technique borrowed by most CSS-in-JS libraries to scope their styles.
- **Explicit dependencies** enable simplified reasoning about the code because the classes applied in the markup don't reference <LinkTo part={1} hash="implicit-dependencies">implicit CSS classes</LinkTo>. Instead, there is an explicit reference between the definition of the style and its usage.
- **Contextual styling** is another core feature of CSS-in-JS libraries, enabling us to define nested rules, media queries, and pseudos within a single style definition, thus preventing code duplication.
- **Avoiding zombie code** is mainly a consequence of having explicit dependencies because every component defines or imports its styles. Thus, when we remove the component or don't import it anymore, its styles will also be ignored during bundling.

This overlap could explain why so many developers disregard CSS-in-JS from the start. For instance, their problems might be already solved by CSS Modules or other forms of encapsulation in conjunction with a CSS processor.

### Beyond static styling

However, CSS-in-JS solves other problems as well, beyond what CSS Modules or CSS processors can achieve:

- **Code navigation** features, such as _Go to definition_ or _Find all references_, are not available with plain CSS. JavaScript-defined styles unlock the power of tools specific to programming languages, significantly improving the development experience.
- **Dynamic styling** is prevalent in highly interactive applications. **State-based styling** like _toggling styles_ or _component variations_ and **user-defined styles** are trivial and straightforward to implement with CSS-in-JS.
- **Sharing variables** from (S)CSS to JavaScript and vice-versa is technically possible but requires additional boilerplate, and it's error-prone. With CSS-in-JS, we can share not only `constants` or `variables`, but also `types`, `functions`, or any other JS code.
- **Type-checking** is not possible with regular CSS. If a style is missing or a class name misspelled, no tool will help us notice the problem. CSS-in-JavaScript unlocks the power of type-checking, covered in detail in <LinkTo part={8} />.

<br />

In addition, CSS-in-JS unlocked other features that turned out to be trivial to implement, thanks to having all style definitions in JavaScript:

- **Theming** and especially **runtime theme toggling** is supported by most CSS-in-JS solutions.
- **Critical CSS extraction** for Server-Side Rendered pages is implemented in all CSS-in-JS libraries that support SSR.
- **Colocated styles** within the component file, similar to [React Native StyleSheets](https://reactnative.dev/docs/stylesheet), [Vue.js SFC](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html), or [Angular Components](https://angular.io/guide/component-styles) go hand in hand with component-based approaches.
- **Lazy loading styles** comes out of the box with dynamically loaded components.

## The basics

To better understand how CSS-in-JS works, let's imagine a fictional library that supports typical CSS-in-JS features. The first thing we'll have to do is to import the styling API, typically a function called `css` or `styled`:

```jsx
import { css } from "css-in-js-library";
```

### Styles definition

Depending on the library's support, the imported styling function will receive the CSS styles as input, either as a **JavaScript Object/JSON** or as a **Tagged Template** string.

<SideBySide width="content" left={{lang: "JS", file: "JavaScript Object syntax"}} right={{lang: "JS", file: "Tagged Template syntax"}}>

```jsx
const title = css({
  fontSize: "2rem",
  color: DARK_BLUE,
});
```

```jsx
const title = css`
  font-size: 2rem;
  color: ${DARK_BLUE};
`;
```

</SideBySide>

Most libraries prefer the **Object syntax** because it's more performant, as **Tagged Templates** require an additional parsing step from `string` to `object`. However, some libraries like **Emotion**, **Goober**, **JSS**, or **Compiled** are quite flexible, supporting both syntaxes.

    Thorough Analysis of CSS-in-JS
  </a>
  .
</Note>

### Styles attachment

Now that we've defined the styles, let's explore how to apply them to HTML elements. There are three different approaches that CSS-in-JS libraries typically support.

<Subheading>Class strings API</Subheading>

The most intuitive and popular API returns a uniquely generated `string` representing the element's CSS class name.

```js
const title = css(/* CSS rules */);

// ➡️ unique string: "1dbj"
```

The main benefit of this approach is that it resembles the traditional way of styling. But, at the same time, this method is **agnostic of the underlying JS framework**, working with any JavaScript framework, or using vanilla DOM APIs:

<SideBySide left={{lang: "JSX", file: "Using JSX syntax"}}  right={{lang: "JS", file: "Using Vanilla DOM APIs"}}>

```jsx
export const Page = () => (
  <h1 className={title}>...</h1>
);
```

```js
document.body.innerHTML = `
  <h1 class="${title}">...</h1>
`;
```

</SideBySide>

<Subheading>
  <code>Styled</code> component API
</Subheading>

A second method, popularized by the **styled-components** library, which also gave its name, takes a different approach. Instead of defining the styles first and applying them to existing HTML elements afterward, a typical `styled` API will receive the type of element along with its styles.

```jsx
const Title = styled("h1")(/* CSS rules */);

// ➡️ new <Title /> component
```

As a result, it will return a new component with the CSS class already applied. This method works well with component-based approaches, encapsulating the element's definition with its styles and removing the mapping required with standard CSS.

```jsx
export const Page = () => (
  <Title>...</Title>
);
```

Consequently, the end result will be the same:

```html
<h1 class="1dbj">...</h1>
```

Libraries that support the `Styled` component API include **styled-components**, **Emotion**, **JSS**, **Goober**, **Compiled**, and **Stitches**. It's worth noting that this approach is mostly used with JSX-based frameworks.

<Subheading>
  <code>css</code> prop API
</Subheading>

The third method, introduced by **Glamor** and popularized by **Emotion** uses a non-standard attribute, typically named `css`, to specify the element's styles.

```jsx
export const Page = () => (
  <h1 css={/* CSS rules */}>...</h1>
);
```

The `css` prop API is less prevalent, being supported by fewer libraries, including **Emotion**, **styled-components**, **Compiled**, or **Goober**. This approach is typically implemented with JSX-based frameworks, where attributes are called props, hence the name of this method.

<br />

### Styles output

So far, we've only covered a few methods to define and apply the styles to HTML elements. But how does the browser handle the styles written in JavaScript?

As browsers cannot parse CSS defined in JavaScript files, one way to render the styles in the browser is to inject them at runtime. This approach is known as **runtime stylesheets**, and it's the most popular one among existing libraries.

Additional JavaScript code called the library runtime has to be bundled and shipped to the browser for this to work. This code will **inject** the required styles in the browser and **update** them accordingly whenever a user event triggers a style change.

<Figure>
  <ThemedImg
    light={img_runtime_light.src}
    dark={img_runtime_dark.src}
    width={1400}
    height={1080}
    alt="Styles defined in JavaScript and applied to component's HTML elements are parsed by the CSS-in-JS library runtime, which generates unique CSS class names, and injects the CSS rules as style tags inside the document's head"
  />
</Figure>

The Runtime Stylesheets method is not the only approach. As we'll later see, there are libraries capable of generating [Static CSS files](#static-css-extraction) that can be referenced like any regular stylesheet. In addition, other solutions that can even generate [Atomic CSS](#atomic-css-in-js).

<Note title="Further reading">

  </a>
  .
</Note>

Now that we've covered the basics, let's turn our attention to several features that set CSS-in-JS apart from other authoring paradigms.

## Dead code elimination

Removing unused code is not limited to CSS-in-JS, as it also works with CSS Modules. However, with CSS-in-JS we get more fine-grained and efficient results:

- with CSS Modules, dead code elimination works at **component or file level**;
- but dead code elimination works at the **element or style level** in CSS-in-JS.

<br />

Consider the following implementation with CSS Modules:

<SideBySide left={{lang: "JSX", file: "footer.jsx (with CSS Modules)"}}  right={{lang: "CSS", file: "footer.module.css"}}>

```tsx
import styles from "./footer.module.css";

export function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer>
      <p className={styles.contact}>Get in touch</p>
      {/* <p className={styles.copyright}>Copyright 2021</p> */}
    </footer>
  );
}
```

```css
.contact {
  color: "black";
}

/* 😡 will be bundled, even thow it's not used */
.copyright {
  color: "grey";
}
```

</SideBySide>

**All styles defined in the imported CSS Module will be bundled, even the unused ones**. There is no trivial way to ensure that a particular class isn't actually used in the code.

As long as the `<Footer />` component is imported somewhere in the application, the entire `.css` file will also be bundled. However, if the `<Footer />` component is not imported anymore, the `.css` file will also be removed from the bundle.

<br />

Next, let's look at the same implementation, but using CSS-in-JS instead:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<Side header={{ lang: "JSX", file: "footer.jsx (with CSS-in-JS)" }}>

```tsx
import { css } from "css-in-js-library";

const contact_styles = css({ color: "black" });

// 😌 will not be bundled, as it is not referenced
const copyright_styles = css({ color: "grey" });

export function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer>
      <p className={contact_styles}>Get in touch</p>
      {/* <p className={copyright_styles}>Copyright 2021</p> */}
    </footer>
  );
}
```

</Side>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

With CSS-in-JS, on the other hand, we have a more direct reference between styles definition and its usage. In our example, `copyright_styles` is just a JavaScript constant. Its styles won't be bundled since it's not referenced anywhere in the component code.

In addition, linters can highlight [unused identifiers](https://eslint.org/docs/2.0.0/rules/no-unused-vars), which we can safely delete. Therefore, the source code is also easier to maintain.

## Shared variables

There are many reasons for <LinkTo part={1} hash="shared-variables">sharing custom values</LinkTo> between CSS and JavaScript code, even in small websites. On the other hand, larger applications, especially those using a **design system**, will likely require us to share **design tokens**.

With CSS-in-JS, we don't have to perform explicit conversions or rely on tools to automate the conversions between (S)CSS and JS variables. Since all styles are defined and applied in JavaScript, they can reference any JS identifiers:

```jsx
import { css } from "css-in-js-library";
import { theme, desaturate } from "./theme.js";

const COLOR = "#f45919";

const heading_styles = css({
   // local defined constant
  color: COLOR,
   // imported design token
  padding: theme.default_spacing,
   // computed value
  background: desaturate(0.2, COLOR),
});

export function Title() {
  return <h1 className={heading_styles}>Heading</h1>;
}
```

<br />

It's needless to say that sharing any code between logic, styles, and markup becomes straightforward with CSS-in-JS.

## Code navigation

As we've all probably experienced by now, we read, debug, and change code more often than writing it. That's why navigating effortlessly through code is essential, especially with large or unfamiliar codebases.

Consider a simple task as _exploring what CSS rules are defined for a particular CSS class applied to an element_:

- Using plain (S)CSS requires us to **copy the CSS class**, **paste it into a search tool** and append a dot `.` so we'll find its definition.
- With CSS Modules, the process is the same, even though we're explicitly importing the styles.

<Subheading>
  <Status type="ok" />
  Go to Definition
</Subheading>

With CSS-in-JS, all styles are JavaScript constants. The editor will instantly open the style definition using `Ctrl + click` (`CMD + click` on Mac) or selecting [Go to Definition](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-definition).

<Subheading>
  <Status type="ok" />
  Find all References
</Subheading>

The opposite task is also simple. To discover the usages of a style referenced (or any other variable, for that matter), we can `Right-click` on the identifier and select [Find All References](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_29#_references-view) from the context menu.

<br />

Navigating code easily is not a measurable feature, but once we get used to it and feel its usefulness, it becomes obvious that it dramatically improves the overall development experience.

## Static CSS Extraction

There are a lot of complaints about CSS-in-JS regarding its **runtime overhead**, as it requires additional code to evaluate, inject, and update styles in the browser. Indeed, this overhead exists and varies between `1.1 kB` and `18.2 kB` gzipped and minified.

However, libraries like **Astroturf**, **Linaria**, or **vanilla-extract** implement static CSS file extraction, generating actual `.css` files at build time, which are included in our document as any regular CSS Stylesheet.

<Figure>
  <ThemedImg
    light={img_static_light.src}
    dark={img_static_dark.src}
    width={1400}
    height={1080}
    alt="At build time, Static CSS extraction libraries parse the styles defined in JavaScript and applied to component's HTML elements, generating actual CSS files with unique CSS class names"
  />
</Figure>

This technique adds **zero runtime cost**. Thus, we get all the benefits of CSS-in-JS regarding the development experience and at the same time having no runtime cost, similar to regular CSS.

  </a>
  for more details.
</Note>

## Atomic CSS-in-JS

Some libraries like **Fela**, **Compiled**, **Stitches**, and **Stylex** took CSS-in-JS to another level. Instead of generating CSS classes containing all defined rules, they focused on generating unique and atomic classes.

<Figure>
  <ThemedImg
    light={img_atomic_light.src}
    dark={img_atomic_dark.src}
    width={1400}
    height={1080}
    alt="Atomic CSS-in-JS libraries parse the styles defined in JavaScript and applied to component's HTML elements, generating atomic class names for each unique CSS rule"
  />
</Figure>

Now, the beautiful part about Atomic CSS-in-JS is that we don't have to learn the specific set of class names of a particular Atomic CSS framework. Instead, we write the styles like we usually do with CSS-in-JS.

It's the library's responsibility to **generate the required atomic CSS classes**.

### Statically Atomic CSS-in-JS

Before we conclude, we should also mention solutions like **vanilla-extract** + **Sprinkles**, or **Style9**, which combine Static CSS extraction and Atomic CSS, bringing together the benefits of all three paradigms covered so far:

- the development experience of CSS-in-JS;
- the small and optimized file size of Atomic CSS;
- the trivial caching of Static stylesheets.

---

Before we move on, let's take a step back and recap what CSS-in-JS is all about:

- **Styles encapsulation**, so CSS Modules, Shadow DOM, or other CSS scoping techniques are not required.
- **Variables** and **contextual styles**, like the rule nesting and parent selector, render CSS preprocessors obsolete.
- **Fine-grained dead code elimination**, successfully removing any unused styles at build time out-of-the-box.
- **Powerful code navigation** support, enabling features such as Go to definition and Find all references.
- **Atomic classes**, eliminating the need to learn and use Atomic CSS or Utility-first frameworks.
- **Static stylesheets**, when runtime cost is a deal-breaker for using CSS-in-JS.

<br />

But, there's more. In the final chapter, <LinkTo part={CURRENT_PART + 1} />, we'll explore the benefits of using TypeScript on top of existing CSS-in-JS solutions, providing **type safety** for our CSS code.
