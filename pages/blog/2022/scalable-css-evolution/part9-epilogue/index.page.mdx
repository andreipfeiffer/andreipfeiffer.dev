During this series, we've covered almost two decades of innovation regarding CSS authoring tools and techniques. Since we're slowly approaching the present day and also the end of this chronicle, it's time to take a step back, reflect on the knowledge we've gained, and draw some conclusions.

Here's a summary of what we'll cover in this epilogue:

- [**Paradigms**](#paradigms):  
  [Semantic CSS](#semantic-css), [Atomic CSS](#atomic-css) & [CSS in JS](#css-in-js)
- [**Static vs. Runtime Stylesheets**](#static-vs-runtime-stylesheets)
- [**Type safety**](#type-safety)
- [**Closing thoughts**](#closing-thoughts)
- [**Acknowledgments**](#acknowledgments)

## Paradigms

To simplify things, we have three different paradigms we can choose from to address the scalabilities issues of CSS. Of course, we'll usually choose one of them, but it's essential to remember that they are **not mutually exclusive**.

In practice, no matter which approach we choose as our primary paradigm, we'll probably use the others as well in particular situations. For instance:

- With **Semantic CSS**, we'll most probably use a fair amount of [atomic utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/api/) like all Semantic CSS frameworks include.
- Similarly, with **Atomic CSS**, we'll have to use semantic classes to define styles for CSS animations, descendant selectors, or pseudo-classes.
- In **dynamic applications**, where the user defines styles for an element's `position`, `size`, or `color`, we'll have to update those styles from JavaScript.
- Even with **CSS in JS**, we'll have to turn to regular stylesheets whenever we need to override 3rd party CSS code.

<br />

So, let's recap and synthesize what these paradigms are all about.

### Semantic CSS

It's safe to say that <LinkTo part={4} hash="semantic-css">Semantic CSS</LinkTo> is the _de facto_ standard within the developers' community and the traditional paradigm of CSS styling.

Semantic CSS encourages using class **names that describe the meaning** of the HTML element they represent, not their implementation. Such class names include `.card`, `.button`, or `.video-player` and contain all the required styles for that particular element. This approach creates a _clear separation between content and style_.

However, some things are worth mentioning about Semantic CSS when we think about CSS maintainability and scalability:

<EmojiList>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="😕">
    <p>
      The <strong>CSS code will continually grow</strong> as we add new
      features, which could potentially lead to large <code>.css</code> files.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🧐">
    <p>
      <strong>Styles encapsulation</strong> using{" "}
      <LinkTo part={5} hash="css-modules">
        CSS Modules
      </LinkTo>{" "}
      or{" "}
      <LinkTo part={5} hash="shadow-dom">
        Shadow DOM
      </LinkTo>{" "}
      is essential for scaling and maintaining Semantic CSS. Without them, we'll
      have to address the global namespace problem using{" "}
      <LinkTo part={4}>CSS methodologies and architectures</LinkTo>, which, as
      we saw, are not trivial to scale or maintain in the long term.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="😉">
    <p>
      We'll probably use <LinkTo part={3}>CSS Processors</LinkTo> for{" "}
      <strong>nesting and contextual styles</strong>, which are key features,
      especially when using media queries in Responsive Web Design.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
</EmojiList>

<br />

Even though the large majority of classes have semantic names, we'll also be using a fair amount of non-semantic and reusable utility classes for quick and punctual style overrides.

### Atomic CSS

As an alternative, <LinkTo part={6}>Atomic CSS</LinkTo> takes a totally different approach, fully embracing non-semantic and reusable utility classes such as `.text-bold` or `.display-flex`. These classes explicitly describe their implementation and contain a single CSS rule.

<EmojiList>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🤩">
    <p>
      The CSS code will not grow indefinitely, and the{" "}
      <strong>total CSS size will be considerably smaller</strong> than Semantic
      CSS.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="😴">
    <p>
      Stylesheets can have <strong>longer cache time</strong>, as we'll mostly
      use existing CSS definitions without adding new ones.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🤨">
    <p>
      There will be an <strong>increase in markup size</strong>, as we'll need
      to attach more classes on HTML elements.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="😌">
    <p>
      We <strong>don't need other tools</strong> for scaling CSS since the
      fundamental principles of Atomic styles address most CSS scalability
      issues.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🧐">
    <p>
      We'll have to <strong>learn a framework</strong> unless we want to
      implement our own.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
</EmojiList>

<br />

Some edge-cases might require traditional semantic classes for CSS animations, descendant or compound selectors, or certain pseudo-classes such as `::before` or `::after`.

### CSS-in-JS

When the styles depend tightly on behavior, separating them will only impede development and maintenance as well. That's why <LinkTo part={7}>CSS in JS</LinkTo> is a perfect fit for **highly interactive applications**, where most styles are **dynamically computed** based on user actions.

<EmojiList>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🤲">
    <p>
      Any CSS-in-JS library provides support for{" "}
      <strong>contextual styles</strong> and{" "}
      <strong>styles encapsulation</strong>, therefore we don't need additional
      tools like CSS Processors or CSS Modules.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="✊">
    <p>
      We have the option to <strong>colocate</strong> the styles with their
      respective component file. Doing so removes one layer of indirection and
      improves component maintenance.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🤝">
    <p>
      We can easily <strong>share variables</strong> between styles and logic,
      which could play an important role in dynamic applications or design
      systems.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
</EmojiList>

<br />

But nowadays, CSS-in-JS use cases are not limited to highly dynamic applications.

<EmojiList>
<EmojiList.Item emoji="😊">
  <p>
    Libraries such as{" "}
    <a href="https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/">
      vanilla-extract
    </a>{" "}
    or{" "}
    <a href="https://linaria.dev/">
      Linaria
    </a>{" "}
    support <strong>
      static <code>.css</code> files extraction
    </strong>, providing the development experience of CSS in JS besides the caching advantages of traditional stylesheets.
  </p>
</EmojiList.Item>

<EmojiList.Item emoji="😎">
  <p>
    Other approaches, such as{" "}
    <a href="https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/sprinkles-api/">
      vanilla-extract + Sprinkles
    </a>{" "}
    and <a href="https://github.com/johanholmerin/style9">style9</a>, output{" "}
    <strong>Atomic styles</strong> on top of static CSS extraction. This
    eclectic approach provides the benefits of all 3 paradigms simultaneously.
  </p>
</EmojiList.Item>

</EmojiList>

<!-- Probably the most difficult and annoying aspect of CSS-in-JS is that there are more than 50 different libraries to choose from. **Picking one library is really difficult.** Not to mention that many of them are experimental or have been abandoned. Considering that we're working on a long-term project, choosing a solution that will still be maintained a few years from now is essential.

I've spent 2 months [thouroughly analizing most CSS-in-JS libraries](https://github.com/andreipfeiffer/css-in-js/blob/main/README.md#overview) so I personally know the pain. Hopefully, you can find useful information from the study. -->

  />
</Figure>

<br />

An interesting observation is that each CSS paradigm employs one of the 3 languages used for front-end web development:

<EmojiList>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🔵">
    <p>
      With <strong>Semantic CSS</strong>, we use regular CSS stylesheets to
      define the styles. We also touch HTML markup to apply the classes, but the
      actual CSS rules are written in CSS files.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🟢">
    <p>
      With <strong>Atomic CSS</strong>, we apply existing CSS classes directly
      to HTML elements. The atomic classes might be defined in CSS stylesheets,
      but from the authoring perspective, we'll actually touch only the markup
      files during development.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🟡">
    <p>
      With <strong>CSS in JS</strong>, as the name implies, all style
      definitions are moved to JavaScript files. Even if we use static CSS
      extraction or Atomic CSS-in-JS, the actual style definition takes place in
      JS/JSX files.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
</EmojiList>

## Static vs. Runtime Stylesheets

So far, we've looked at CSS from the **authoring** perspective. Another angle we can explore is analyzing the **output and loading** of the stylesheets.

### Static Stylesheets

Whether we're using _Semantic_ or _Atomic CSS_, _CSS processors_, _CSS Modules_, or _CSS-in-JS with static extraction_, what we get in the end is one or more static `.css` files that we'll include in the `<head>` of our document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

<br />

Every single web developer is familiar with this method to load CSS, as this is the standard approach. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind:

<EmojiList>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🤐">
    <p>
      By default, any <code>.css</code> file included in the document's{" "}
      <code>head</code> element is a{" "}
      <a href="https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/">
        rendering blocking resource
      </a>
      . Depending on the file size, compression ratio, network conditions, server
      response time, latency, user bandwidth, and CPU power, loading a <code>
        .css
      </code> file could degrade the <a href="https://web.dev/speed-index/">
        Speed Index
      </a> or the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://web.dev/extract-critical-css/">
        Extracting critical CSS
      </a>{" "}
      aka. <em>above-the-fold CSS</em> is a solution, but not a trivial one to
      implement, especially with dynamic websites and applications.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🤔">
    <p>
      CSS files are <strong>easily cached</strong> by browsers, preventing
      unnecessary requests for the same file. However, this brings no benefit if
      any style change invalidates the entire CSS file. Frequent changes defeat
      the purpose of caching.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="😇">
    <p>
      Content and styling are strictly separated, meaning we can{" "}
      <strong>update content without invalidating the CSS cache</strong>.
      Therefore static stylesheets are beneficial during Server-Side Rendering.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="😟">
    <p>
      On the other hand, the initially loaded <code>.css</code> file{" "}
      <strong>must contain all the dynamic styles</strong> required by user
      events unless we lazy-load them at runtime.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
</EmojiList>

### Runtime Stylesheets

Whenever we have to deal with user interaction, we'll probably need to update some styles as well. Some basic examples might be adding, removing, or toggling CSS classes from JavaScript event handlers.

**Dynamic styles**, popularized by CSS in JS libraries, will be bundled in JavaScript files during the build. When the JavaScript bundle reaches the browser, the CSS in JS runtime will inject the styles directly into the CSSOM.

<EmojiList>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🥱">
    <p>
      <strong>Lazy-loading</strong> the styles for a particular component
      becomes trivial, since the styles are bundled with their respective
      component.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🧟">
    <p>
      <strong>Dead code elimination</strong> is provided out of the box, as
      unreferenced style definitions will not end up in the JavaScript bundle.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="😧">
    <p>
      Dynamic stylesheets typically require more code to be shipped to the
      browser. Extra <strong>runtime code</strong> is necessary to handle
      dynamic styles, varying between <code>1.1 kB</code> and{" "}
      <code>18.2 kB</code>. In addition, the{" "}
      <strong>critically extracted styles will be shipped twice</strong> during
      Server-Side Rendering: once for the initial render and second when bundled
      in JS files during the build.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🧐">
    <p>
      <strong>First paint metrics might be faster</strong>, even though we're
      shipping more bytes. Since regular stylesheets block the rendering of the
      page, removing them altogether should speed up the loading.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
</EmojiList>

## Type safety

Traditional web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JS typically lack any kind of type safety, leading to cumbersome maintenance and fear of touching existing code.

Using **static type checkers** like TypeScript or Flow provides type safety for the logical part of the code. With JSX-based syntax, type checkers also provide type safety for the component's markup. But adding static type checkers on top of CSS in JS, we can finally achieve type safety for styles as well.

<EmojiList>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🧭">
    <p>
      <strong>Code navigation tools</strong> embedded in most editors and IDEs
      are beneficial to go to styles definition quickly or find their usage
      within a large code base.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🧰">
    <p>
      <strong>Refactoring tools</strong> aid us when renaming, extracting, and
      moving code around. Code refactoring is essential during long-term
      maintenance.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🔔">
    <p>
      <strong>Instant type checking</strong> highlights any unused definitions,
      misspelled identifiers, or incorrect function calls.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="🔐">
    <p>
      <strong>Typed interfaces</strong> for UI components enforce solid
      contracts for the consumers. Passing invalid input becomes very unlikely.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
  <EmojiList.Item emoji="📚">
    <p>
      Static types are typically <strong>self-documented</strong>, being
      beneficial for any developer reading the code.
    </p>
  </EmojiList.Item>
</EmojiList>

## Closing thoughts

In the end, it's just a matter of scalability. For example, we could compare code maintenance with traveling from one place to another, considering that the effort scales proportionally with the distance. Additionally, the more people we travel with, the more difficult it is to coordinate them.

<Subheading>🚶 Walking</Subheading>

First, let's consider walking. We don't need any rules or regulations as the traveling speed is relatively low. To decrease traveling time, we can choose to **run**, or even take a **bike**.

However, none of these approaches will get us very far. In addition, each person traveling with us will have to put in the same amount of effort. In the context of CSS, the same limitations apply to **standard Semantic CSS** and the **good practices** necessary for scaling.

<!-- Therefore, to travel long distances, we would need to use a different method. -->

<Subheading>🚙 Driving</Subheading>

If we want to travel farther, we'll probably take a car. This method scales a bit better, as the effort to travel long distances is considerably lower than walking. We can also take additional people with us, without additional costs on their side.

But driving on public roads requires specific rules and regulations: we must have a driving license, learn the priority signs, use signaling lights, etc. In the context of scalable CSS, this translates to using **CSS methodologies** for individual components and high-level architecture.

We might even take the highways at some point, as they are specifically designed to enable higher speeds. Using **styles encapsulation**, learning an **Atomic CSS framework**, or choosing a **CSS-in-JS solution**, provide similar benefits, as they remove a considerable part of the manual effort required to manage the code.

<Subheading>✈️ Flying</Subheading>

Now, what if we have to travel even farther or get to a different continent over the seas? Even driving exclusively on highways could take days to reach our destination. On the other hand, taking a plane allows us to reach faraway places quickly and with minimal effort.

However, getting on a plane is not straightforward: we need a passport, get through security checks, and follow strict regulations during the flight. Both the airport and the flight company have to enforce stringent security measures.

**Type-safe CSS** using a static type checker provide similar mechanics. They enforce safety checks, which allows us to move faster and farther, without a proportional amount of effort.

<br />

> Figuring out how far we want to go will help us make educated decisions regarding what tools best suits our journey.
