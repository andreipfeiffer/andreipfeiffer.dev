In the previous chapter, <LinkTo part={CURRENT_PART - 1} />, we analyzed the most concerning problems with writing and maintaining CSS code. Now it's time to turn our attention to solving the issues of scalable CSS.

Let's begin our journey by exploring how to **avoid complex CSS selectors** and **specificity wars**. Therefore, let's focus on essential good practices that equally apply nowadays, as they did many years ago:

- [Keep specificity low](#keep-specificity-low)
- [Avoid applying styles on IDs](#avoid-applying-styles-on-ids)
- [Avoid type selectors](#avoid-type-selectors)
- [Avoid mimicking HTML structure](#avoid-mimicking-html-structure)
- [Avoid using `!important`](#avoid-using-important)

<Note title="Important">
  It should be noted that this is not at all a comprehensive list, as the topic
  of maintainable CSS is pretty vast. <br />
  <br /> In addition, as their name suggests, these are <strong>
    practices
  </strong>, not dogmas. Even if we treat them as rules, there are always understandable{" "}
  <strong>exceptions</strong>.

## Keep specificity low

The <LinkTo part={1} hash="specificity-wars">specificity wars</LinkTo> are amongst the most dreadful problems to face as a UI developer. To avoid them, we must keep specificity as low as possible.

Sometimes we tend to be overzealous when writing CSS selectors instead of keeping them simple. For example, defining **overly specific CSS selectors** by abusing [descendant combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator) will result in high specificity while also coupling the targeted element with the HTML structure:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css
/* ‚ùå BAD: overspecific selector (1.4.3 specificity) */
#header .main_menu ul li.item a.link {}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Let's analyze this code for a second:

- If there is a single `.main_menu` element on the page, then the `#header` selector is unnecessary.
- The descendant selector `ul li.item` should not be necessary if all `a.link` elements are placed inside the `ul`. Thus we can skip this selector altogether.
- Last but not least, we shouldn't care that the `.link` is also an `a` element, so we can safely remove the `a` selector.

<br />

Thus, the above selector could be easily simplified while also reducing its specificity:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css
/* üëç GOOD: less specific selector (0.2.0 specificity) */
.main_menu .link {}

/* ‚úÖ BEST: simple selector (0.1.0 specificity) */
.main_menu_link {}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<Subheading>Excessive nesting with CSS preprocessors</Subheading>

With CSS preprocessors it's even easier to create high specificity, thanks to their nesting feature. Unfortunately, we often write **excessive nesting**, which is way too overused and creates significant scalability problems.

<SideBySide left={{lang: "SCSS", file: "style.scss (source)"}}  right={{lang: "CSS", file: "style.css (output)"}}>

```scss
// ‚ùå excessive nesting
.main_menu {
  ul {
    li {
      .link {
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```scss
// ‚ùå overspecific CSS output
.main_menu {
}
.main_menu ul {
}
.main_menu ul li {
}
.main_menu ul li .link {
}
```

</SideBySide>

<br />

We could easily reduce the specificity of the output CSS selectors by limiting the number of nesting levels:

<SideBySide left={{lang: "SCSS", file: "style.scss (source)"}}  right={{lang: "CSS", file: "style.css (output)"}}>

```scss
// üëç less nesting
.main_menu {
  ul {
  }
  li {
  }
  .link {
  }
}
```

```scss
// üëç lower specificity output
.main_menu {
}
.main_menu ul {
}
.main_menu li {
}
.main_menu .link {
}
```

</SideBySide>

<br />

<Subheading>So, how low is "low enough"?</Subheading>

Keeping specificity low is definitely going to be helpful in the long run. But what exactly does "low" mean? How "low" should we keep it, and when does it become "too high"?

A rule of thumb used to say that _CSS selectors should not have more than 2 descendants or levels of nesting_. Thus, it's common sense to say that:

- use **a single CSS class** as the goto option: `.main_menu_link`;
- use **1 descendant** when overriding is necessary: `.dark-theme .main_menu_link`;
- use **2 descendants only in extreme scenarios** when the previous rules don't apply.

## Avoid applying styles on IDs

Sometimes _we might think_ that a particular HTML block will only be displayed a single time on the page, so we could be inclined to use [ID selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors) for styling. Such examples might include the **page's header**, the **contact form**, or the **product details page**. However, two significant problems could occur when we apply styles on ID selectors.

<Subheading>1. Unexpected overridden styles</Subheading>

Let's consider an HTML block called `.profile`, which contains an `.image` element. This block of content is used only on a specific page, for instance, `post-listing.html`:

<SideBySide left={{lang: "HTML", file: "post-listing.html"}}  right={{lang: "CSS", file: "style.css"}}>

```html
<div class="profile">
  <img src="..." class="image" />
</div>
```

```css
.profile .image {
  /* üòå these styles work as expected */
  border: 1px black solid;
}
```

</SideBySide>

<br />

At some point, we want to reuse the `.profile` content block on a different page, namely `post-details.html`. Unfortunately, that page already contains an `.image` element, which is used inside an **ID selector** in CSS:

<SideBySide left={{lang: "HTML", file: "post-details.html"}}  right={{lang: "CSS", file: "style.css"}}>

```html{1-2,9}
<div id="post-details">
  <img src="..." class="image" />

  <!-- re-use the .profile block on another page -->
  <div class="profile">
    <img src="..." class="image" />
  </div>

</div>
```

```css{1-4}
#post-details .image {
  /* üòà IDs have higher specificity than classes */
  border: 10px grey solid;
}

.profile .image {
  /* üò° these style will get overridden */
  border: 1px black solid;
}
```

</SideBySide>

<br />

In these circumstances, the `.profile .image` styles will get overridden by the more specific `#post-details .image` selector. We could change the class names to avoid collisions, but the fundamental problem still remains: **reusing HTML blocks could render different styles, depending on where we include them**.

Any non-deterministic behavior is potentially a critical problem when thinking about long-term maintainability.

<Subheading>2. Lack of reusability</Subheading>

The last time I checked, [foreseeing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foresight_(psychology)>) future needs is very debatable. In addition, my own past experiences strongly support that we are generally bad when making predictions.

It happened to me so many times to think that _"we'll never have more than one Contact Form"_, only to find out one week later that we needed to add a _Subscribe Form_, which looked mostly as the existing _Contact Form_.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css
/* ‚ùå code smell which proves that we cannot foresee the usage of code blocks */
#contact-form,
#subscribe-form {}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<br />

Therefore, to prevent any of the problems mentioned above, we should avoid applying styles on ID selectors altogether and **use classes instead**:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css
/* ‚ùå avoid using ID selectors in CSS */
#contact-form {}

/* ‚úÖ use classes instead */
.contact-form {}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<Note>
  It's perfectly fine to use IDs in HTML for{" "}
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#linking_to_an_element_on_the_same_page">
    anchor links
  </a>
  . But, we should <strong>avoid referencing IDs in CSS</strong> selectors.
</Note>

## Avoid type selectors

CSS [type selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors) match HTML elements by their tag name. It's very tempting to use type selectors because we can focus on CSS code, without polluting the HTML markup with `class` attributes. Unfortunately, this practice ultimately leads to unexpected problems.

<Subheading>1. Tight coupling</Subheading>

When using type selectors, we create a **coupling between the markup and the styles**. As a result, changing the markup will unexpectedly break the styles.

Let's look at a common example:

<SideBySide left={{lang: "HTML", file: "index.html"}}  right={{lang: "CSS", file: "style.css"}}>

```html
<div class="card">
  <h2>Title</h2>
</div>
```

```css
.card h2 {
}
```

</SideBySide>

- we have a `.card` element that contains a title placed inside an `h2`;
- we apply the styles using the `.card h2` selector.

<br />

At some point, somebody needs to replace the `h2` with an `h3`, which is a trivial change and we shouldn't be concerned of breaking anything, right?

```diff
 <div class="card">
-  <h2>Title</h2>
+  <h3>Title</h3>
 </div>
```

<br />

If we wrote this code ourselves one week ago, we might already _know_ that we have to update the styles, as well. Similarly, if we deal with a small codebase, we should be able to fix it easily.

However, on large projects, these problems grow exponentially:

- Without knowing that there are styles applied to the `h2` element that we need to update as well, there's a high chance of introducing regressions.
- Debugging such a problem could be cumbersome because the styles are applied implicitly, not explicitly.

Thus, the **styles will be coupled with the markup**. We cannot change the markup without updating the styles as well. Whenever we have a **tight coupling** between parts of code that should be modified independently, without affecting one other, we have a scalability problem.

<Subheading>2. Lack of isolation</Subheading>

Nevertheless, **adding new markup** could also be problematic when using type selectors. For example, an existing CSS rule could match the newly added tag, **rendering unexpected results**.

<!-- Another really annoying problem we might encounter when working with type selectors occurs when adding new HTML markup. -->

Let's consider the following scenario:

<SideBySide left={{lang: "HTML", file: "index.html"}}  right={{lang: "CSS", file: "style.css"}}>

```html{3}
<div class="card">
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <strong>Keywords</strong>
</div>
```

```css{1}
.card strong {
  font-size: 0.75em;
  color: grey;
}
```

</SideBySide>

- We have a `<strong>` element in our markup, which contains **specific** content for "keywords".
- The styles for the "keywords" content are set using the `.card strong` tag selector, as it doesn't require us to add a new CSS class in the markup.

<br />

Now, it's not uncommon to add other HTML markup, at some point, that might also include a `<strong>` element:

```html{6}
<div class="card">
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <strong>Keywords</strong>

  <!-- üò° the "highlighted" text will have unexpected styles -->
  <p>Some <strong>highlighted</strong> description</p>
</div>
```

The problem is that both `<strong>` elements will share the same styles, which might not be the expected result:

- We would expect the newly added `<strong>highlighted</strong>` content to render as **generic** `bold` text, maintaining the `color` and `font-size` of the parent `<p>` element.
- We don't want it to inherit the **specific** styles of `<strong>Keywords</strong>` content.

<br />

The solution for preventing the aforementioned problems is quite simple: avoid targetting HTML tags in CSS and **use classes** instead.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css
/* ‚ùå BAD: avoid tag names */
.card h2 {}

/* üëç BETTER: classes are more flexible & isolated */
.card .title {}

/* ‚úÖ BEST: single classes are ideal */
.card_title {}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

As a result, changing the markup will not affect the styles. In addition, classes provide better styles isolation, preventing unexpected results when updating the markup.

<Subheading>
  <Status type="ok" />
  Exceptions
</Subheading>

As problematic as type selectors are, there are a few exceptions where they are helpful or even required:

1. **Resetting or normalizing CSS** implicit user-agent styles;

2. **Styling dynamic content from a headless CMS** because we get plain HTML content without any class names. Thus, we must target elements by their type, for instance, `.blog_post h2`.

## Avoid mimicking HTML structure

Sometimes we might be inclined to define CSS selectors based on an existing HTML structure. However, similar to type selectors, mimicking the HTML structure in our CSS code will also couple the markup with its styles, thus producing **rigid CSS code**.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```scss
// ‚ùå BAD: unneeded "nav" ancestor
.main_menu nav .link {}

// üëç BETTER: less structure dependent
.main_menu .link {}

// ‚úÖ BEST: using a single class
.main_menu_link {}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<Subheading>Combinator selectors</Subheading>

Another related scenario is using **strict combinator selectors** such as [child combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator) or [adjacent sibling combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator), also creating tight coupling.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```css
/* ‚ùå What if we need to wrap the .logo in a <div />? */
.header > .logo {}

/* ‚ùå What if we need to display the label first? */
.checkbox + .label {}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Scenarios that absolutely require using strict combinator selectors are very scarce. Therefore using **classes simply scaled better**.

## Avoid using `!important`

At some point, we might be tempted to use `!important` as an attempt to fix the specificity wars. But, unfortunately, it's a losing battle. Many of us tried to make it work, but none of us succeeded. Even [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#:~:text=Using%20!important%2C%20however%2C%20is%20bad%20practice%20and%20should%20be%20avoided) documents it as a **bad practice**.

If we use `!important` to fix the specificity wars, it won't take long until the **!important wars** start. At some point, we'll need to override already `!important` rules, which is possible but disastrous.

> When we end up overriding an `!important` CSS rule, we hit rock bottom regarding CSS maintainability!

<Subheading>
  <Status type="ok" />
  Exceptions
</Subheading>

Imagine the irony: even such an important advice, as avoiding `!important`, has a few [important exceptions](https://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/) worth mentioning:

1. **Overriding 3rd party styles**, especially with high specificity, is cumbersome to override using conventional methods.

2. **Defining utility classes** such as `.bold` or `.align-center`, because they could be easily overridden by accident.

---

## The problems with good practices

Once we learn and understand all these practices, it should be fairly easy to apply them, right? Unfortunately, it's not a trivial task at all.

- There is **no official comprehensive guide** on how to write maintainable CSS. I've only covered a few of the essential practices, but there are [so many more](http://khaidoan.wikidot.com/css-best-practices) to consider.
- Some of the **practices don't apply equally** to every project, with every team. Also, developers tend to be very opinionated, so we rarely reach a consensus regarding a specific set of rules.
- Due to the fact that there are so many practices, and most of them quite debatable, they are **cumbersome to learn and teach**.
- As we've seen, there are plenty of **exceptions** that apply. It's often quite challenging to draw a line when it's acceptable to break the rule.
- Some practices are typically **impossible to enforce**. While there are linters that can be used to enforce certain rules, we'll still have to rely on constant code review, training, and mentoring.
- Once we have an existing large application written without these practices in mind, they become **tough to introduce into an existing codebase**. Changing CSS, in general, is a fragile task, so most developers avoid big refactorings.
- Last but not least, **good practices don't scale**! The larger the code base, the more burdensome the maintenance will become.

<br />

However, we call them _"good"_ or even _"best"_ practices because they indeed help us. They were the first community effort to address the innate maintainability issues of CSS.

But they're not perfect. They don't fix all the problems. And you know how engineering works:

> As long as there's a problem, there's also a solution waiting to be discovered.

---

Therefore, we still have many other problems to solve, and our journey has just begun. So let's pack our bags and move on.

In the next chapter, **<LinkTo part={CURRENT_PART + 1} />**, we'll cover **CSS preprocessors**, which enable a cleaner source code, and **CSS postprocessors** that optimize the CSS output.
