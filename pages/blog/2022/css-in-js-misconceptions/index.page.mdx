In 2014, a new way to author CSS emerged, called **CSS-in-JavaScript**. The initial motivation for the technique was to fix the inherent <LinkTo part={1}>scalability issues of CSS</LinkTo>.

However, the first implementations were not perfect. Over the years, countless iterations were born, constantly improving and evolving <LinkTo part={7}>CSS-in-JS</LinkTo> authoring. Consequently, at the time of writing, there are more than 50 CSS-in-JS libraries out there.

This kind of iteration is crucial for the evolution of new technology. But unfortunately, this process backfires when trying to adopt CSS-in-JS, as it gets cumbersome to fully understand it.

### CSS-in-JS is not React only

While it's true that some CSS-in-JS libraries are specifically built for React, the large majority of them are [framework agnostic](https://css-tricks.com/a-thorough-analysis-of-css-in-js/#aa-react-specific-or-framework-agnostic). Any library that generates CSS class names can be used with any JavaScript framework, or with no framework at all:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```jsx
import { css } from "goober";

// this will return a string representing a unique CSS class name
const title_styles = css({ color: "blue" });

// the class name can be applied as any regular CSS class
const template = `<h1 class="${title_styles}"> Title </h1>`
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Additionally, [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/) is the first CSS-in-JS library, which is also maintained today. Even though JSS added a React plugin later on, it was initially built without React in mind.

On the other hand, what **_is true_** is that CSS-in-JS is more prevalent within the React ecosystem, as there's no built-in solution for style encapsulation. For instance, Angular, Vue, or Svelte have built-in support for scoping styles. Therefore there aren't notable or popular implementations of CSS-in-JS libraries in other frameworks, at least as of May 2022.

### CSS-in-JS doesn't use inline styles

None of the currently existing CSS-in-JS libraries use inline styles as output. Libraries like [Radium](https://formidable.com/blog/2019/radium-maintenance/) and [Glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor) used inline styles, but both libraries have been discontinued.

Inline styles have limited support for CSS syntax, making it impossible to define certain pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, or media queries. In addition, common pseudo-classes like `:hover` or `:focus` required sub-optimal workarounds by attaching DOM event listeners and triggering style updates using JavaScript.

<br />

The [css prop](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#use-the-css-prop) method used by Emotion resembles inline styles definition, but under the hood, it actually generates unique CSS class names similar to CSS Modules or any other CSS-in-JS library.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from '@emotion/react'

// the `css` prop will generate scoped CSS class names
const Title = <h1 css={{ color: "blue" }}>Title</h1>;

// > Output:
<h1 class="css-bp9m3j">Title</h1>
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->


### CSS-in-JS supports all the CSS syntax

All modern CSS-in-JS libraries support the full CSS syntax. I have [analyzed more than 10 libraries](https://github.com/andreipfeiffer/css-in-js/), focusing primarily on features such as **pseudo-classes and elements**, **media queries**, and **keyframe animations**.

Each library provides its own syntax and APIs to support the above features, but they generally have a low learning curve. As far as my knowledge and understanding go, there aren't any CSS syntax or features that CSS-in-JS does not support.

### CSS-in-JS is not equivalent with _styled components_

One of the popular libraries that use CSS-in-JS is called [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). Furthermore, they also introduced a new way to apply the JS styles to the desired HTML elements, a technique which is also called **Styled components**.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```jsx
import { styled } from "styled-components";

// returns a new <Title /> component, with CSS class name attached
const Title = styled("h1")({ color: "blue" });
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This approach eliminates the mapping between HTML elements and their styles, returning a new component with the CSS class name(s) already applied. This contrasts with the standard CSS approach, which implies defining the styles separately and attaching them to existing HTML elements. Other CSS-in-JS libraries, like [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled), [Goober](https://goober.js.org/api/styled/), [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/docs/api#styled), or [Compiled](https://compiledcssinjs.com/docs/api-styled), also support this approach.

But in the end, **_a Styled component is only a technique to attach CSS styles to a DOM element or an existing component_**. There are alternative solutions for <LinkTo part={7} hash="styles-attachment">CSS-in-JS styles attachment</LinkTo> if there's a reason for not using the _Styled_ syntax.

### CSS-in-JS doesn't enforce camelCase syntax

The object styles syntax, which uses `camelCase` CSS rules, is one way to define CSS-in-JS styles. The alternative is the **tagged templates syntax**, supported by libraries like [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals), [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#string-styles), [Goober](https://goober.js.org/api/styled/#tagged-templates-functions), and [Compiled](https://compiledcssinjs.com/docs/api-css-prop#template-literal-rules), allowing developers to write styles exactly like regular CSS.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```jsx
import { css } from "goober";

// Goober's css() function also supports tagged templates
const title = css`
  background-color: blue;
`;
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

What **_is true_** is that **object syntax** is the preferred method for [CSS-in-JS styles definition](https://css-tricks.com/a-thorough-analysis-of-css-in-js/#aa-styles-definition-syntax), as it is simpler, more lightweight, and more optimal than template strings. As styles are eventually computed as JavaScript code, defining them directly as objects doesn't require additional string parsing.

Switching from regular CSS syntax using `kebab-case` properties to the object syntax using `camelCase` syntax might seem daunting. But in reality, you get the hang of it within days.

### CSS-in-JS is not for ignorants

One recurring prejudice that you'll often find is that most developers that use CSS-in-JS don't really understand how CSS works.

Firstly, using CSS-in-JS without knowing regular CSS won't fill any language knowledge gaps. We'll use the same **CSS rules**, **layout** techniques, **positioning** options, and **CSS units** for values.

Secondly, let's think about <LinkTo part={5}>styles encapsulation</LinkTo>, to eliminate the need for manually managing CSS class names. If CSS-in-JS is only for ignorants, then we should also put **CSS Modules**, **Shadow DOM**, and **Atomic CSS** in the same bucket. In the end, what all of these paradigms and techniques are doing is removing the reliance on the _CSS cascade_ and the _global namespace_.

On the contrary, fully understanding the pitfalls of the CSS cascade and global styles should determine us to circumvent them, especially in large scale applications.

### CSS-in-JS breaks the separation of concerns

When this argument comes up, it typically refers to the separation of content (HTML), styles (CSS), and behavior (JS). This separation makes perfect sense when thinking of websites or applications where content is king, like blogs, documentation, presentational websites, etc.

React was the first library to _put the HTML in JS_ in the form of `JSX`. Later on, React also popularized CSS in JS. The main reason for this is the **component-based architecture** that most JavaScript frameworks adopted. Components encapsulate content, styling, and behavior since all these _concerns_ relate and depend on each other. They belong together, therefore it makes no sense to separate them.

This mindset is also adopted by [Angular components](https://angular.io/guide/component-styles), [React Native StyleSheets](https://reactnative.dev/docs/stylesheet), [Vue Single-File Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html), and [Lit components](https://lit.dev/docs/components/styles/#add-styles). The reason is quite simple: _code maintenance_ is essential when developing large applications.

### CSS-in-JS requires an additional build step

This argument only makes sense when writing pure CSS, without CSS Processors. But, honestly, if no such tools are needed, then it doesn't make sense to use CSS-in-JS in the first place.

However, any CSS-related tooling requires some sort of processing, performed during one or more build steps. This includes CSS Processors, CSS Modules, Atomic CSS, etc.

Considering that any CSS-in-JS library already provides everything other tools offer, we would actually replace multiple build steps with a single one.

<!-- ### CSS-in-JS processing overhead JS -> CSS

asd -->

### CSS-in-JS ships additional code

Most popular CSS-in-JS libraries, like **styled-components**, **Emotion**, **JSS**, and others output their styles as <LinkTo part={7} hash="runtime-stylesheets">runtime stylesheets</LinkTo>. They indeed require additional code to be shipped, which varies between `6kB` and `18kB` minified and gzipped.

However, there are also very _**lightweight CSS-in-JS**_ solutions like **Goober**, which ships only `1kB` of additional code.

Additionally, if that is still too much, there's always the alternative of <LinkTo part={7} hash="static-css-extraction">static CSS extraction</LinkTo>. This approach is implemented by **vanilla-extract**, which doesn't require any additional runtime code, having the same impact as _plain old regular CSS_.

### CSS-in-JS requires learning another library

Well, this is undeniable. If we want to use a CSS-in-JS library, we'll have to learn its syntax.

However, when this argument is used against CSS-in-JS as a paradigm, we'll have to compare it with the alternatives:

- Atomic CSS also requires us to learn a framework, not to mention that their surface is typically much larger.
- Any CSS Methodology or architecture requires us to learn it, not to mention the constant effort of making sure everyone on the team applies it properly.
- CSS Modules are usually used with a CSS Preprocessor, requiring us to learn not one, but two different libraries.

In the end, if we want to use any tools for managing CSS, _we'll have to learn_ how to use them.

### CSS-in-JS doesn't enforce styles colocation

Not everyone agrees that styles belong in their respective component file. Fortunately, with CSS-in-JS, we can always move the styles in a separate file:

<Side header={{ file: "title.styles.js", lang: "JS" }}>

```js
import { css } from "goober";

// export styles
export const title = css({ color: "blue" });
```

</Side>

... and import them in the component file, which resembles the usage of CSS Modules:

<Side header={{ file: "title.js", lang: "JSX" }}>

```js
import * as styles from "./title.styles.js";

export function Title() {
  return <h1 className={styles.title}>Heading</h1>;
}
```

</Side>

<br />

Therefore, we can colocate styles for relatively small components with CSS-in-JS, removing one layer of [indirection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection). But we also have the flexibility to extract them in separate files.

On the other hand, with regular CSS, we have only one option.

The above list is not comprehensive. Therefore, if you have any other misconceptions that should be clarified, please [get in touch](/contact). I would love to hear your thoughts.

In conclusion, CSS-in-JS shouldn't be judged from the perspective of a specific library. Instead, CSS-in-JS is a technique, a paradigm, and an alternative approach to classical CSS authoring.
